In this age of literature such collections on a very grand scale are not uncommon,-143.04399999999998
Mr and Mrs Musgrove took me and we were so crowded,-98.80699999999999

He is not a gallant man but he is a very humane one and this considering Jane Fairfax s ill health would appear a case of humanity to him and for an act of unostentatious kindness there is nobody whom I would fix on more than on Mr Knightley,-427.667

I have heard it asserted said John Knightley that the same sort of handwriting often prevails in a family and where the same master teaches it is natural enough,-256.465
But you who have known Miss Fairfax from a child must be a better judge of her character and of how she is likely to conduct herself in critical situations than I can be,-294.083

At any rate I shall expect you to morrow,-86.92699999999999
Her Christian name I always forget her Christian name,-99.28299999999999

Will Mr Frank Churchill pass through Bath as well as Oxford,-117.26000000000002
Mamma you are not doing me justice,-70.548
What would you do yourself,-45.795
I know it is replied her mother seriously or after such a warning I should be the last to encourage such affection or even to be pleased by it,-240.78300000000004
You always called me Mr Knightley and from habit it has not so very formal a sound And yet it is formal,-205.28500000000003
She and Mary were actually setting forward for the Great House where as she afterwards learnt they must inevitably have found him when they were stopped by the eldest boy s being at that moment brought home in consequence of a bad fall,-415.7320000000001
Surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she had just quitted where they found only Willoughby who was leaning against the mantel piece with his back towards them,-293.459
But I do assure you it was so for all that and I will tell you how it happened,-148.69699999999997

He appeared to have a very open temper certainly a very cheerful and lively one she could observe nothing wrong in his notions a great deal decidedly right he spoke of his uncle with warm regard was fond of talking of him said he would be the best man in the world if he were left to himself and though there was no being attached to the aunt he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect,-741.3699999999998
It was growing quite dusk however before they were in the neighbourhood of Uppercross and there had been total silence among them for some time Henrietta leaning back in the corner with a shawl over her face giving the hope of her having cried herself to sleep when as they were going up their last hill Anne found herself all at once addressed by Captain Wentworth,-606.6360000000001
Do help me,-32.268
Mrs Weston s friends were all made happy by her safety and if the satisfaction of her well doing could be increased to Emma it was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl,-301.46500000000003
Four o clock depend upon it he will be here by three was Mr Weston s quick amendment and so ended a most satisfactory meeting,-253.49399999999994
said he to Emma and trying as he spoke to catch Miss Fairfax s eye,-130.559
I am sure I should have seen it in a moment if Mrs Ferrars had took a dislike to me,-165.458
Emma saw how Mr Weston understood these joyous prospects,-101.32500000000002
Her sufferings have been very severe,-61.18599999999999
Beyond you three is there a creature in the world whom I would not rather suspect of evil than Willoughby whose heart I know so well,-236.33099999999996
By whom can you have heard it mentioned,-77.41600000000001
She would have been glad to know when these difficulties were to cease this opposition was to yield when Mrs Ferrars would be reformed and her son be at liberty to be happy,-287.55400000000003
His information and prospects as to Enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated Mrs Churchill was recovering and he dared not yet even in his own imagination fix a time for coming to Randalls again,-363.64900000000006
She could soon tell at what coachmaker s the new carriage was building by what painter Mr Willoughby s portrait was drawn and at what warehouse Miss Grey s clothes might be seen,-291.1869999999999
I had a few lines on parish business from Mr Weston this morning and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened,-255.859

Mr Perry had been to Mrs Goddard s to attend a sick child and Miss Nash had seen him and he had told Miss Nash that as he was coming back yesterday from Clayton Park he had met Mr Elton and found to his great surprize that Mr Elton was actually on his road to London and not meaning to return till the morrow though it was the whist club night which he had been never known to miss before and Mr Perry had remonstrated with him about it and told him how shabby it was in him their best player to absent himself and tried very much to persuade him to put off his journey only one day but it would not do Mr Elton had been determined to go on and had said in a very particular way indeed that he was going on business which he would not put off for any inducement in the world and something about a very enviable commission and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious,-1497.622999999999
Had not Mrs Weston any letter about her to produce,-90.473
what do you mean,-35.395
I had not the smallest intention of asking him said Elizabeth with affected carelessness but he gave so many hints so Mrs Clay says at least,-252.42299999999997
So seldom that a letter among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom is even carried wrong and not one in a million I suppose actually lost,-280.768
Mr Elliot looking up with so much respect,-74.93
If ever there were people who without having great wealth themselves had every thing they could wish for I am sure it is us,-220.029
He had never been in the room at the Crown in his life did not know the people who kept it by sight Oh,-202.819
Only think of those sweet verses To Miss,-88.663
The real evils indeed of Emma s situation were the power of having rather too much her own way and a disposition to think a little too well of herself these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments,-364.3520000000001
cried Marianne again So calm so cheerful how have you been supported,-121.631
Harriet was to be there in the evening and the Bateses,-83.806
Mr Shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman s family and mentioned a place and Anne after the little pause which followed added,-216.417
Low I am afraid sir very low answered his son but we shall be indulgent especially to any one who leads the way,-211.03800000000004
I met one as I came Madness in such weather absolute madness,-114.05900000000001
Mrs Dashwood would have interrupted her instantly with soothing tenderness had not Elinor who really wished to hear her sister s unbiased opinion by an eager sign engaged her silence,-287.70799999999997
Charles Anne must not it,-41.863
It was much easier to chat than to study much pleasanter to let her imagination range and work at Harriet s fortune than to be labouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts and the only literary pursuit which engaged Harriet at present the only mental provision she was making for the evening of life was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort that she could meet with into a thin quarto of hot pressed paper made up by her friend and ornamented with ciphers and trophies,-819.7879999999998
oh,-14.607
This was all sent with the instrument,-62.053
And the dried cherries too,-36.666000000000004
Mrs John Knightley was a pretty elegant little woman of gentle quiet manners and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate wrapt up in her family a devoted wife a doating mother and so tenderly attached to her father and sister that but for these higher ties a warmer love might have seemed impossible,-500.47900000000016
Surry is full of beauties,-54.636
I was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire,-106.708
As moderate as those of the rest of the world I believe,-103.04199999999999
And so I am not to be surprized that Jane Fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her,-153.70900000000003
Such behaviour as this so exactly the reverse of her own appeared no more meritorious to Marianne than her own had seemed faulty to her,-215.412
Exactly so The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth I have not a doubt of your success,-187.85999999999999
,0.0
Very beautiful indeed replied Emma and she spoke so kindly that he gratefully burst out,-153.277
Marianne I dare say will not leave her room again this evening,-107.855
Anne and me are to go the latter end of January to some relations who have been wanting us to visit them these several years,-232.07899999999998
It seems on the contrary to have been a perfectly spontaneous untaught feeling on his side and this surprises me,-173.527
You saw what she said,-43.510999999999996
A week to morrow And I have hardly begun to enjoy myself,-116.78700000000002
what can you possibly have to do,-58.94499999999999
Well mother I have done something for you that you will like,-100.755
Elinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming such feelings she only endeavoured to counteract them by working on others represented it therefore as a measure which would fix the time of her returning to that dear mother whom she so much wished to see in a more eligible more comfortable manner than any other plan could do and perhaps without any greater delay,-591.154
I cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor with praise encouragement and offers of service that she will not be continually detailing her magnificent intentions from the procuring her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche landau,-499.4390000000001
That I am sure you would,-50.479
Mr Knightley is coming too,-45.624
Emma who was not really at all frightened herself tranquillised this excess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs Goddard s experience and care but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she could not wish to reason away which she would rather feed and assist than not she added soon afterwards as if quite another subject,-543.4560000000001
She could only resolve to avoid such self delusion in future and think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing of having one such truly sympathising friend as Lady Russell,-291.138
I managed it extremely well,-39.56
Two such she did not want,-56.869
She looked back as well as she could but it was all confusion,-107.91900000000001
My beau indeed,-36.150000000000006
Why does not he try Bath Indeed he should,-90.32700000000001
Ah,-12.359
How do you do Mrs Ford,-57.123000000000005
Sir Walter Elizabeth and Mrs Clay returned one morning from Laura Place with a sudden invitation from Lady Dalrymple for the same evening and Anne was already engaged to spend that evening in Westgate Buildings,-346.84700000000004
The gentleman offered his services and perceiving that her modesty declined what her situation rendered necessary took her up in his arms without farther delay and carried her down the hill,-317.9190000000001
Did you not think him dreadful low spirited when he was at Barton,-125.89699999999998
and to see you in such excellent looks I would not have missed this meeting for the world,-151.08200000000002
We have carriages to fetch and convey her home and we live in a style which could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax at any time the least inconvenient I should be extremely displeased if Wright were to send us up such a dinner as could make me regret having asked more than Jane Fairfax to partake of it,-546.0480000000001
And so saying she took the screens out of her sister in law s hands to admire them herself as they ought to be admired,-225.875
and Elizabeth to do her justice had in the first ardour of female alarm set seriously to think what could be done and had finally proposed these two branches of economy to cut off some unnecessary charities and to refrain from new furnishing the drawing room to which expedients she afterwards added the happy thought of their taking no present down to Anne as had been the usual yearly custom,-641.3259999999999
You had better leave me was all the notice that her sister received from her,-124.96699999999998
The contrast between Mrs Churchill s importance in the world and Jane Fairfax s struck her one was every thing the other nothing and she sat musing on the difference of woman s destiny and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed till roused by Miss Bates s saying,-466.262
A little disordered always the first twenty four hours of going to sea but never knew what sickness was afterwards,-200.09499999999997
What years of felicity that man in all human calculation has before him Assured of the love of such a woman the disinterested love for Jane Fairfax s character vouches for her disinterestedness every thing in his favour equality of situation I mean as far as regards society and all the habits and manners that are important equality in every point but one and that one since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted such as must increase his felicity for it will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants A man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from and he who can do it where there is no doubt of her regard must I think be the happiest of mortals Frank Churchill is indeed the favourite of fortune,-1238.868999999999
I have taken some pains for your sake and for Robert Martin s sake whom I have always had reason to believe as much in love with her as ever to get acquainted with her,-304.00400000000013
Emma your infatuation about that girl blinds you,-75.47899999999998
continued Lucy after wiping her eyes I think whether it would not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely,-206.872
It would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfied with her situation for a change is not very probable there,-207.99099999999999
you will think very differently when you are married,-81.687
When she could give another glance he had moved away,-98.01599999999999
Before the end of September Emma attended Harriet to church and saw her hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction as no remembrances even connected with Mr Elton as he stood before them could impair Perhaps indeed at that time she scarcely saw Mr Elton but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on herself Robert Martin and Harriet Smith the latest couple engaged of the three were the first to be married,-764.6599999999999
She could not think that Harriet s solace or her own sins required more and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they returned but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive Mr Elton is so good to the poor,-577.2469999999997
It was adventuring too far assuming too much making light of what ought to be serious a trick of what ought to be simple,-220.863
Emma my dear Emma,-35.643
Had she left her where she ought and where he had told her she ought Had she not with a folly which no tongue could express prevented her marrying the unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy and respectable in the line of life to which she ought to belong all would have been safe none of this dreadful sequel would have been,-587.004
Mermaids and sharks,-17.683
Emma seriously hoped she would,-48.802
I am going to London to spend a few days with John and Isabella,-123.417
She was not so materially cast down however but that a little time and the return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives,-181.945
At length she replied,-43.743
Henrietta asked him what he thought of you when they went away and he said You were so altered he should not have known you again,-225.23999999999998
Me,-15.022
And very nice young ladies they both are I hardly know one from the other,-138.195
If I could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired but is Mrs Stokes to be trusted,-157.66500000000002
I am sure Miss Fairfax must have found the evening pleasant Emma,-107.057
I believe I have lived as much on board as most women and I know nothing superior to the accommodations of a man of war,-216.578
You had better order the carriage directly my love said she I dare say we shall be able to get along if we set off directly and if we do come to any thing very bad I can get out and walk,-385.737
While waiting for the carriage she found Mr Knightley by her side,-109.21200000000002
I think differently now time and sickness and sorrow have given me other notions but at that period I must own I saw nothing reprehensible in what Mr Elliot was doing,-279.189
Never madam cried he affronted in his turn never I assure you,-121.89999999999998
She felt immediately that she should like him and there was a well bred ease of manner and a readiness to talk which convinced her that he came intending to be acquainted with her and that acquainted they soon must be,-348.98600000000005
At this moment an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma s brain with regard to Jane Fairfax this charming Mr Dixon and the not going to Ireland she said with the insidious design of farther discovery,-348.7770000000001
you would rather talk of her person than her mind would you,-98.17399999999999
I assure you the utmost stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in private life,-220.96599999999998
Campbell,-12.8
As soon as they returned to the carriage Mrs Jennings was eager for information but as Elinor wished to spread as little as possible intelligence that had in the first place been so unfairly obtained she confined herself to the brief repetition of such simple particulars as she felt assured that Lucy for the sake of her own consequence would choose to have known,-587.1220000000003
And I assure you I never was better pleased in my life and I wish you joy of it with all my heart,-188.59300000000002
This is all that I can relate of the how where and when,-107.02199999999999
Miss Nash had told her all this and had talked a great deal more about Mr Elton and said looking so very significantly at her that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be but she only knew that any woman whom Mr Elton could prefer she should think the luckiest woman in the world for beyond a doubt Mr Elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness,-619.3809999999999
For their own comfort they would much rather have remained at least all the morning in Mrs Jennings s house but it was not a thing to be urged against the wishes of everybody,-295.57300000000004
We shall never agree about him cried Emma but that is nothing extraordinary,-124.21600000000001
He will be able to tell her how we all are,-92.13299999999998
And yet a few minutes afterwards she felt as if their being in company with each other under their present circumstances could only be exposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most mischievous kind,-305.71200000000005
Before he could return to his chair it was taken by Mrs Weston,-116.47199999999998
How could he answer it to himself to rob his child and his only child too of so large a sum,-187.57999999999998
Their attention was called towards the others,-69.122
I think very well of Mr Elton and this is the only way I have of doing him a service,-156.30699999999996
You speak very properly,-41.623999999999995
The usual character of them has nothing for me,-79.71899999999998
Miss Campbell always was absolutely plain but extremely elegant and amiable,-113.45400000000001
An admiral speaks his own consequence and at the same time can never make a baronet look small,-182.36699999999996
You are right,-29.448999999999998
Oh yes I dare say you will,-65.13600000000001
It was not possible that the occurrence should not be strongly recommending each to the other,-143.541
One morning about a week after his leaving the country Marianne was prevailed on to join her sisters in their usual walk instead of wandering away by herself,-270.843
There is an openness a quickness almost a bluntness in Mr Weston which every body likes in him because there is so much good humour with it but that would not do to be copied,-309.22300000000007
Yes quite a proposal of marriage and a very good letter at least she thought so,-138.25199999999998
Her own behaviour had been so very improper,-76.842
You are too obliging my dear Miss Woodhouse but we really must take leave,-135.38899999999998
Marianne began now to perceive that the desperation which had seized her at sixteen and a half of ever seeing a man who could satisfy her ideas of perfection had been rash and unjustifiable,-290.002
Still however affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment,-179.75
The gruel came and supplied a great deal to be said much praise and many comments undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution and pretty severe Philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with tolerable but unfortunately among the failures which the daughter had to instance the most recent and therefore most prominent was in her own cook at South End a young woman hired for the time who never had been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel thin but not too thin,-871.6549999999996
To be constantly living with an ill tempered person must be dreadful,-125.51299999999999
you answer as discreetly as she could do herself,-70.065
I am sorry we cannot see your sister Miss Dashwood said Miss Steele,-123.88999999999999
Yes all of us Mrs Elton would have us come,-87.555
And yet this woman who knows what her art may have been how long it may have been premeditated and how deeply contrived by her Who is she Who can she be Whom did I ever hear him talk of as young and attractive among his female acquaintance Oh,-463.78700000000003
The sea is no beautifier certainly sailors do grow old betimes I have observed it they soon lose the look of youth,-209.12099999999998
I am quite sure he replied speaking very distinctly that he told me she had accepted him and that there was no obscurity nothing doubtful in the words he used and I think I can give you a proof that it must be so,-368.37700000000007
Twice did I leave them purposely together in the course of the last morning and each time did he most unaccountably follow me out of the room,-240.23700000000002
But Marianne in her place would not have done so little,-89.726
I have no reason to think ill of her not the least except that such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal,-407.6759999999999
I cannot keep my eyes from it,-62.526
I am most happy to hear it but only Jane Fairfax one knows to be so very accomplished and superior and exactly Emma s age,-219.79399999999995
A man who had been in motion since eight o clock in the morning and might now have been still who had been long talking and might have been silent who had been in more than one crowd and might have been alone Such a man to quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside and on the evening of a cold sleety April day rush out again into the world Could he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken back his wife there would have been a motive but his coming would probably prolong rather than break up the party,-945.8579999999997
But now it is all too late,-61.247
Is she still in town,-47.218
In Mrs Dashwood s estimation he was as faultless as in Marianne s and Elinor saw nothing to censure in him but a propensity in which he strongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her sister of saying too much what he thought on every occasion without attention to persons or circumstances,-464.517
He looked at them slightly without seeming to know who they were and merely nodded to Mrs Jennings from the other side of the room,-225.65099999999998
Many vain solicitudes would be prevented many awkwardnesses smoothed by it,-109.89200000000001
It was indeed a highly prized letter,-60.989999999999995
Reserved how in what manner,-41.56100000000001
I have no notion of people s making such a to do about money and greatness,-142.81900000000002
This was a subject which ensured Marianne s attention and she was beginning to describe her own admiration of these scenes and to question him more minutely on the objects that had particularly struck him when Edward interrupted her by saying You must not enquire too far Marianne remember I have no knowledge in the picturesque and I shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste if we come to particulars,-668.1259999999999
You made a lucky guess and that is all that can be said,-109.56299999999997
Such schemes as these are nothing without numbers,-88.993
Emma in good spirits too from the amusement afforded her mind by the expectation of Mr Frank Churchill was willing to forget his late improprieties and be as well satisfied with him as before and on his making Harriet his very first subject was ready to listen with most friendly smiles,-452.2300000000001
It could be protracted no longer,-48.68300000000001
She could not stay,-34.313
What indeed ma am,-42.736
Lady Russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject and gave it much serious consideration,-149.028
They had been once more in the same room,-75.553
She was in gay spirits and would have prolonged the conversation wanting to hear the particulars of his suspicions every look described and all the wheres and hows of a circumstance which highly entertained her but his gaiety did not meet hers,-368.062
Her early impressions were incurable,-53.074999999999996
Edward it is so and I will say it,-66.944
No no Frederick is not a man to whine and complain he has too much spirit for that,-153.29500000000002
Here is my sketch of the fourth who was a baby,-97.198
yes I am quite aware of that,-61.283
She would be never led into temptation nor left for it to find her out,-136.094
He was a nervous man easily depressed fond of every body that he was used to and hating to part with them hating change of every kind,-252.077
Knightley s Alas,-33.979
Emma was sorry to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like through three long months to be always doing more than she wished and less than she ought,-280.311
She had never received from her more than outward attention nothing beyond the observances of complaisance had never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry against previous inclination,-285.839
After an interval of some minutes however he began with,-97.15100000000001
There could be no doubt as to Miss Elliot,-74.754
I know it all I know it all cried Mrs Smith,-87.50199999999998
I wished for him again the next summer when I had still the same luck in the Mediterranean,-149.547
Her father s business was to announce James s being gone out to put the horses to preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls and she had therefore an immediate excuse for disappearing,-317.668
But not a bit did Walter stir,-71.707
I have quite a horror of upstarts,-54.510000000000005
How attentive she is to think of every body Thank you my dear for shewing it me,-152.30800000000002
Part of my lace is gone said she and I do not know how I am to contrive,-159.283
He continued,-20.478
She was so surprized she did not know what to do,-88.65299999999999
Her attention was now claimed by Mr Woodhouse who being according to his custom on such occasions making the circle of his guests and paying his particular compliments to the ladies was ending with her and with all his mildest urbanity said,-387.34000000000015
They appear to so much advantage in company with each other,-101.876
How much worse had they been obliged to meet,-83.15599999999999
There he had not always the patience that could have been wished,-100.09700000000002
Her connexions may be worse than his,-69.24
You are a good woman he warmly replied,-74.655
Did she know had she heard any thing about her since their being at Randalls he felt much anxiety he must confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably,-288.13599999999997
The ladies had not been long in the drawing room before the other ladies in their different divisions arrived,-177.065
Mrs Jennings knowing nothing of any change in the patient went unusually early to bed her maid who was one of the principal nurses was recreating herself in the housekeeper s room and Elinor remained alone with Marianne,-333.936
She could not be too soon alarmed nor send for Perry too often,-126.606
Even pleasure you know is fatiguing and I cannot say that any of them seemed very much to have enjoyed it,-173.078
If you please my dear,-48.607
Mr Elton and I are very good friends and nothing more and she walked on amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances of the mistakes which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into and not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant and in want of counsel,-591.9770000000002
And with this pleasing anticipation she sat down to reconsider the past recall the words and endeavour to comprehend all the feelings of Edward and of course to reflect on her own with discontent,-309.034
Make a civil message but I shall only leave my card,-104.51599999999999
Lady Elliott wished to give a dance,-72.092
Upon my word it is Miss Bates He really is engaged from morning to night There is no end of people s coming to him on some pretence or other The magistrates and overseers and churchwardens are always wanting his opinion,-362.1259999999999
Design could never bring them in each other s way negligence could never leave them exposed to a surprise and chance had less in its favour in the crowd of London than even in the retirement of Barton where it might force him before her while paying that visit at Allenham on his marriage which Mrs Dashwood from foreseeing at first as a probable event had brought herself to expect as a certain one,-679.379
To separate Edward and Elinor was as far from being her object as ever and she wished to show Mrs John Dashwood by this pointed invitation to her brother how totally she disregarded her disapprobation of the match,-354.844
I have known her from a child undoubtedly we have been children and women together and it is natural to suppose that we should be intimate that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited her friends,-346.4680000000001
End of volume one,-45.365
Is she angry,-32.351
I d rather you would,-45.538
I cannot think there is any danger of it was Emma s calm answer and when you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax s situation and understand what her home has been with Colonel and Mrs Campbell I have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown,-437.82500000000005
Mr Elton I must beg leave to stop at your house and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or string or any thing just to keep my boot on,-291.955
Elinor saw and pitied her for the neglect of abilities which education might have rendered so respectable but she saw with less tenderness of feeling the thorough want of delicacy of rectitude and integrity of mind which her attentions her assiduities her flatteries at the Park betrayed and she could have no lasting satisfaction in the company of a person who joined insincerity with ignorance whose want of instruction prevented their meeting in conversation on terms of equality and whose conduct toward others made every shew of attention and deference towards herself perfectly valueless,-898.8039999999997
She must be collected and calm,-56.923
He had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle his horror of late hours and large dinner parties made him unfit for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms,-344.561
Captain Benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the Laconia and the account which Captain Wentworth had given of him on his return from Lyme before his warm praise of him as an excellent young man and an officer whom he had always valued highly which must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener had been followed by a little history of his private life which rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies,-739.1149999999997
There was too much wind to make the high part of the new Cobb pleasant for the ladies and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower and all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight excepting Louisa she must be jumped down them by Captain Wentworth,-502.148
there he is,-23.087
Mary is good natured enough in many respects said she but she does sometimes provoke me excessively by her nonsense and pride the Elliot pride,-246.767
The varieties of handwriting were farther talked of and the usual observations made,-128.743
I owed it to her therefore to avoid giving any hint of the truth and I owed it to my family and friends not to create in them a solicitude about me which it could not be in my power to satisfy,-353.52600000000007
We live at home quiet confined and our feelings prey upon us,-120.89
This little circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before,-100.046
It would not be likely to produce that dejection of mind which frequently attended him,-141.819
She tried to dissuade Mary from going but in vain and that being the case thought it best to accept the Miss Musgroves much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise as she might be useful in turning back with her sister and lessening the interference in any plan of their own,-481.54999999999995
Harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion,-87.66
My Elinor is it possible to doubt their engagement,-81.067
Did you see her often at Weymouth,-67.79400000000001
Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own,-209.61900000000003
With such a knowledge as this it was impossible for Elinor to feel easy on the subject,-146.80300000000003
Well if you please said Mrs Weston rather hesitating if you think she will be of any use,-164.42100000000002
The event was more favourable to Mr Woodhouse than to Emma,-95.06499999999998
She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes in talking and listening and forming all these schemes in the in betweens that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate and the supper table which always closed such parties and for which she had been used to sit and watch the due time was all set out and ready and moved forwards to the fire before she was aware,-675.179
I have not a doubt of it said Marianne and I have nothing to regret nothing but my own folly,-158.323
To do what would be most generally pleasing must be our object if one could but tell what that would be,-188.19600000000003
my dear sir how are you this morning,-74.79599999999999
And you must be off this very morning,-68.902
Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer and advised its being written directly which was agreed to in the hope of her assistance and though Emma continued to protest against any assistance being wanted it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence,-433.666
Against the interest of her own individual comfort Mrs Dashwood had determined that it would be better for Marianne to be any where at that time than at Barton where every thing within her view would be bringing back the past in the strongest and most afflicting manner by constantly placing Willoughby before her such as she had always seen him there,-535.336
He walked off to find his father but was quickly back again with both Mr and Mrs Weston,-161.84099999999995
I have a note of his Do not you remember Mrs Weston employing him to write for you one day,-173.69699999999997
Elinor tried to talk of something else but Miss Steele could not be kept beyond a couple of minutes from what was uppermost in her mind,-226.08099999999996
Mrs Musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness for the play if Henrietta and all the others liked it when Mary eagerly interrupted her by exclaiming,-286.845
Are no probabilities to be accepted merely because they are not certainties,-117.53899999999999
No I have never seen Mr Elton she replied starting on this appeal is he is he a tall man,-185.79200000000003
You know we have settled all that already,-72.835
Her heart was really grieved,-52.26
This has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed,-96.684
What is Mr Elliot to me,-49.658
She saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed her before,-115.79100000000001
She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful girl which she trusted with such frequent meetings at Hartfield was foundation enough on his side and on Harriet s there could be little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual weight and efficacy,-476.7829999999999
Not above ten miles I dare say,-78.384
my poor dear child the truth is that in London it is always a sickly season,-149.31799999999998
It will be some trial to us both,-74.06099999999999
Such talent as hers must not be suffered to remain unknown I dare say you have heard those charming lines of the poet,-230.41700000000003
About a mile and a half from the cottage along the narrow winding valley of Allenham which issued from that of Barton as formerly described the girls had in one of their earliest walks discovered an ancient respectable looking mansion which by reminding them a little of Norland interested their imagination and made them wish to be better acquainted with it,-614.387
Emma could not have a better companion than Harriet,-76.801
But sometimes of an evening before we went to cards he would read something aloud out of the Elegant Extracts very entertaining,-214.819
Pretty well ma am in the fifteen years of my marriage though many women have done more,-168.486
Merely Gowland he supposed,-42.010000000000005
She has had the advantage you know of practising on me she continued like La Baronne d Almane on La Comtesse d Ostalis in Madame de Genlis Adelaide and Theodore and we shall now see her own little Adelaide educated on a more perfect plan,-386.94500000000005
Be sure to give me intelligence of the letter as soon as possible,-117.462
To be sure,-27.650000000000002
She who had not been able to remain in Louisa s room or to look at her without sufferings which made her worse than helpless,-226.13800000000003
He saw the necessity of inviting the Miss Steeles immediately and his conscience was pacified by the resolution of inviting his sisters another year at the same time however slyly suspecting that another year would make the invitation needless by bringing Elinor to town as Colonel Brandon s wife and Marianne as THEIR visitor,-499.2980000000002
Time a very little time I tell him will do everything Marianne s heart is not to be wasted for ever on such a man as Willoughby His own merits must soon secure it,-308.8130000000001
When one lives in the world a man or woman s marrying for money is too common to strike one as it ought,-212.873
The old lady,-31.37
Smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first glancing towards Miss Fairfax but it was most prudent to avoid speech,-214.688
Elinor smiled again to hear her sister describing so accurately their future expenses at Combe Magna,-166.98499999999999
He had met with them in a little perplexity which must be laid before Emma,-134.607
She must not appear to think it a misfortune With all the spirits she could command she prepared him first for something strange and then in a few words said that if his consent and approbation could be obtained which she trusted would be attended with no difficulty since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all she and Mr Knightley meant to marry by which means Hartfield would receive the constant addition of that person s company whom she knew he loved next to his daughters and Mrs Weston best in the world,-857.8119999999999
Emma why is it that they are your enemies,-73.56899999999999
It was indeed so odd Harriet s behaviour was so extremely odd that Emma did not know how to understand it,-185.935
Anne saw nothing thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room,-95.142
The preparing and the going abroad in such weather with the sacrifice of his children after dinner were evils were disagreeables at least which Mr John Knightley did not by any means like he anticipated nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase and the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his discontent,-576.3470000000001
said she my dear Ferrars do tell me how it is to be managed,-113.17399999999999
I am going home and you have an engagement with your friend,-101.02899999999998
There was no occasion to press the matter farther,-85.44699999999999
Till he came and had examined the child their apprehensions were the worse for being vague they suspected great injury but knew not where but now the collar bone was soon replaced and though Mr Robinson felt and felt and rubbed and looked grave and spoke low words both to the father and the aunt still they were all to hope the best and to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind and then it was just before they parted that the two young aunts were able so far to digress from their nephew s state as to give the information of Captain Wentworth s visit staying five minutes behind their father and mother to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted they were with him how much handsomer how infinitely more agreeable they thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance who had been at all a favourite before,-1392.4379999999996
She knew that when she played she was giving pleasure only to herself but this was no new sensation,-170.701
The sitting was altogether very satisfactory she was quite enough pleased with the first day s sketch to wish to go on,-200.674
He was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys clinging to him like an old friend and declaring he should not go and being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away in his coat pockets c to have another moment for finishing or recollecting what he had begun Anne was left to persuade herself as well as she could that the same brother must still be in question,-649.0169999999999
Some letters had passed between her and her brother in consequence of Marianne s illness and in the first of John s there had been this sentence We know nothing of our unfortunate Edward and can make no enquiries on so prohibited a subject but conclude him to be still at Oxford which was all the intelligence of Edward afforded her by the correspondence for his name was not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters,-679.5829999999999
Mrs Harville a degree less polished than her husband seemed however to have the same good feelings and nothing could be more pleasant than their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own because the friends of Captain Wentworth or more kindly hospitable than their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them,-528.091
Your father will not be easy why do not you go,-100.10299999999998
Always the first person to be thought of,-68.2
I do not know One of the Otways Not Frank it is not Frank I assure you,-137.606
Marianne now looking dreadfully white and unable to stand sunk into her chair and Elinor expecting every moment to see her faint tried to screen her from the observation of others while reviving her with lavender water,-365.0540000000001
This is what I believe to have happened,-67.899
But this is no excuse for their concealing it from us,-101.65500000000002
You forget how much she belongs to Highbury,-80.27799999999999
Jane Fairfax Good God,-47.794
You wrong her exceedingly,-40.86
Emma had never been to Box Hill she wished to see what every body found so well worth seeing and she and Mr Weston had agreed to chuse some fine morning and drive thither,-315.86699999999996
But she was not wanted to speak,-55.43000000000001
A few years before Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl but her bloom had vanished early and as even in its height her father had found little to admire in her so totally different were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own there could be nothing in them now that she was faded and thin to excite his esteem,-581.911
As they were turning into the grounds Mr Perry passed by on horseback,-131.953
I am no young lady on her preferment,-74.49199999999999
He had come in his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill s engagement with no selfish view no view at all but of endeavouring if she allowed him an opening to soothe or to counsel her The rest had been the work of the moment the immediate effect of what he heard on his feelings,-515.409
She could not be deceived in that,-55.446000000000005
If you are very kind said he it will be one of the waltzes we danced last night let me live them over again,-213.63499999999996
But with a reproachful smile at Emma she receives attentions from Mrs Elton which nobody else pays her,-161.99800000000002
She had yet another reason for wishing her children to remain where they were a letter from her son in law had told her that he and his wife were to be in town before the middle of February and she judged it right that they should sometimes see their brother,-446.9260000000002
They went through the particulars of their first meeting a great many times,-125.112
cried Harriet colouring and astonished,-55.146
You do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men,-118.23500000000001
When Lucy first came to Barton Park last November she told me in confidence of her engagement,-165.86799999999997
I must hurry away then to give him those thanks which you will not allow me to give YOU to assure him that he has made me a very an exceedingly happy man,-294.344
Are not you astonished,-41.177
he had never written hardly ever any thing of the kind in his life,-119.131
She listened to her praise of Lucy with only moving from one chair to another and when Mrs Jennings talked of Edward s affection it cost her only a spasm in her throat Such advances towards heroism in her sister made Elinor feel equal to any thing herself,-442.73500000000007
He seems to have a calm decided temper not at all open to dangerous impressions,-146.772
Musgrove take care of the others,-55.223
In general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their mornings but one complete dinner engagement and out of the house too there was no avoiding though at Christmas,-285.852
You know Mrs Weston you and I must be cautious how we express ourselves,-130.324
But when you mentioned Mrs Dixon I felt how much more probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship,-209.948
Her way was clear though not quite smooth She spoke then on being so entreated What did she say Just what she ought of course,-244.99999999999994
I mean said he with serious energy if I can to make you hate me one degree less than you do NOW,-206.471
It would be a crowd a sad crowd and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in,-187.96000000000004
I think Miss Woodhouse you and I must establish a musical club and have regular weekly meetings at your house or ours,-209.713
In respectability of character there can be no doubt that they are,-110.93499999999999
About a fortnight,-33.676
We never were so long without seeing her before and as I was telling Mrs Cole we shall hardly know how to make enough of her now,-234.741
no,-8.042
I mean to offer some kind of explanation some kind of apology for the past to open my whole heart to you and by convincing you that though I have been always a blockhead I have not been always a rascal to obtain something like forgiveness from Ma from your sister,-467.7500000000001
Anne gave her credit indeed for feelings of great consideration towards herself in all that related to Kellynch and it pleased her especially as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute in the instant even of introduction that there was not the smallest symptom of any knowledge or suspicion on Mrs Croft s side to give a bias of any sort,-574.5319999999999
Elton s absence just at this time was the very thing to be desired,-119.44199999999998
You were a good while at Lyme I think,-77.536
I found said he that I was considered by Harville an engaged man,-112.9
Two months must bring it to the proof,-77.29599999999999
At these words Marianne s eyes expressed the astonishment which her lips could not utter,-154.915
You may say what you chuse but your countenance testifies that your thoughts on this subject are very much like mine,-195.50600000000003
He immediately went into the passage opened the front door and ushered her in himself,-148.64800000000002
Her mother sisters Fanny all had been conscious of his regard for her at Norland it was not an illusion of her own vanity,-205.63899999999998
I who am owing all my happiness to you would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be severe on them,-192.191
was repeated by Marianne and her mother in an accent of the utmost amazement and though Elinor could not speak even HER eyes were fixed on him with the same impatient wonder,-294.26200000000006
In this state of schemes and hopes and connivance June opened upon Hartfield,-130.311
I shall be at home in twenty minutes,-69.93400000000001
She was ready to tell every thing in her power but on this subject questions were vain,-153.778
The girls looked all amazement,-55.25399999999999
I saw them turn the corner from Bath Street just now,-107.932
Shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or other,-126.62400000000001
in places you see it is dreadfully dirty and the wainscot is more yellow and forlorn than any thing I could have imagined,-209.66299999999998
And then rising she went away to join Marianne whom she found as she expected in her own room leaning in silent misery over the small remains of a fire which till Elinor s entrance had been her only light,-379.65700000000015
Much much beyond impropriety It has sunk him I cannot say how it has sunk him in my opinion,-188.504
It raises my influence much too high the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is too much for an indifferent person,-237.957
He began with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick chamber again for the present to entreat her to promise him not to venture into such hazard till he had seen Mr Perry and learnt his opinion and though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its proper course there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her,-661.3929999999999
Well my dear said Mrs Jennings and how did you travel,-102.746
I hardly ever get a letter,-54.92400000000001
Miss Elliot do you remember our walking together at Lyme and grieving for him,-135.252
Let me know what you think of this,-68.81400000000001
She heard of her walking with the Eltons sitting with the Eltons spending a day with the Eltons,-164.92400000000004
Nothing but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future,-162.72
Never in her life had Elinor found it so difficult to be calm as at that moment,-148.755
Jealousy of Mr Elliot had been the retarding weight the doubt the torment,-107.72999999999999
Elinor had given her real opinion to her sister,-76.54299999999999
That young man speaking lower is very thoughtless,-89.089
had it by any blessed felicity occurred to her to institute the comparison She saw that there never had been a time when she did not consider Mr Knightley as infinitely the superior or when his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear,-392.189
I like a fine prospect but not on picturesque principles,-99.59700000000001
Every moment rather brought fresh agitation,-71.049
So they will my dear,-46.748000000000005
She exclaimed however with a very tolerable imitation of nature,-89.678
But I want to set your heart at ease as to Mrs S My representation you see has quite appeased her,-202.96000000000004
I declare sometimes I do not know which way to look before them,-112.673
In a long strip of meadow land where there was ample space for all they were thus divided forming three distinct parties and to that party of the three which boasted least animation and least complaisance Anne necessarily belonged,-396.9480000000002
It was but a passing emotion however with Mrs Smith she shook it off and soon added in a different tone,-192.64000000000001
Elinor remembered what Robert had told her in Harley Street of his opinion of what his own mediation in his brother s affairs might have done if applied to in time,-278.057
Colonel Brandon is certainly younger than Mrs Jennings but he is old enough to be MY father and if he were ever animated enough to be in love must have long outlived every sensation of the kind,-338.996
They had the pleasure of assuring her that Bath more than answered their expectations in every respect,-157.66500000000002
Well said I all I can say is that if this be true he has used a young lady of my acquaintance abominably ill and I wish with all my soul his wife may plague his heart out,-333.513
Colonel Brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability,-97.903
The party drove off in very good spirits Sir Walter prepared with condescending bows for all the afflicted tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show themselves and Anne walked up at the same time in a sort of desolate tranquillity to the Lodge where she was to spend the first week,-491.88200000000023
But you shall hear it all When I got to Mr Palmer s I found Charlotte quite in a fuss about the child,-197.51300000000003
There is always a look of consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be beneath them,-197.69700000000003
She regained the street happy in this that though much had been forced on her against her will though she had in fact heard the whole substance of Jane Fairfax s letter she had been able to escape the letter itself,-358.06200000000007
Well well ladies are the best judges but James Benwick is rather too piano for me and though very likely it is all our partiality Sophy and I cannot help thinking Frederick s manners better than his,-355.931
Within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge ware box which Harriet opened it was well lined with the softest cotton but excepting the cotton Emma saw only a small piece of court plaister,-339.57200000000006
He is turning away,-38.949
She was afterwards looking for her shawl Frank Churchill was looking also it was growing dusk and the room was in confusion and how they parted Mr Knightley could not tell,-266.31800000000004
His civilities to the other ladies must be paid but his subsequent object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering and the walk he had had for nothing,-285.03000000000003
Here Mrs Smith paused a moment but Anne had not a word to say and she continued,-147.41699999999997
Thank ye the gloves do very well only a little too large about the wrist but Jane is taking them in,-193.173
There was at times a want of spirits about him which if it did not denote indifference spoke of something almost as unpromising,-196.46699999999998
She paused Her daughter could not quite agree with her but her dissent was not heard and therefore gave no offence,-187.46499999999995
He could meet even Lady Russell in a discussion of her merits and Anne could not be given to understand so much by her friend could not know herself to be so highly rated by a sensible man without many of those agreeable sensations which her friend meant to create,-451.4580000000001
If you think he will come I shall think so too for you know Enscombe,-130.26399999999998
Emma accepted it with a very eager hand with an impatience all alive to know what he would say about it and not at all checked by hearing that her friend was unmentioned,-287.17300000000006
Man s boasted power and freedom all are flown Lord of the earth and sea he bends a slave And woman lovely woman reigns alone,-261.11999999999995
In half a minute Charles was at the bottom of Union Street again and the other two proceeding together and soon words enough had passed between them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet and retired gravel walk where the power of conversation would make the present hour a blessing indeed and prepare it for all the immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives could bestow,-678.4789999999999
The second day brought them into the cherished or the prohibited county of Somerset for as such was it dwelt on by turns in Marianne s imagination and in the forenoon of the third they drove up to Cleveland,-343.82400000000007
He came down by yesterday s coach and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast to report his proceedings first on my affairs and then on his own,-264.302
and that s so dreadful,-40.01
I had none,-25.072000000000003
Elizabeth had turned from him Lady Russell overlooked him her nerves were strengthened by these circumstances she felt that she owed him attention,-220.442
No not immediately here,-38.634
He soon joined them again successful of course Lady Dalrymple would be most happy to take them home and would call for them in a few minutes,-248.82999999999996
Little had Mrs Dashwood or her daughters imagined when they first came into Devonshire that so many engagements would arise to occupy their time as shortly presented themselves or that they should have such frequent invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them little leisure for serious employment,-493.7760000000001
How the long stage would pass how it was to affect their manners what was to be their sort of intercourse she could not foresee,-226.344
A fine place but very retired,-63.368
I may not have convinced you perhaps but I am perfectly convinced myself that Mr Dixon is a principal in the business,-192.674
I do not mean to justify myself but at the same time cannot leave you to suppose that I have nothing to urge that because she was injured she was irreproachable and because I was a libertine SHE must be a saint,-341.6090000000001
If Miss Woodhouse would not be displeased she would rather stay at home,-119.62999999999998
The Miss Dashwoods had no greater reason to be dissatisfied with Mrs Jennings s style of living and set of acquaintance than with her behaviour to themselves which was invariably kind,-282.9429999999999
And books Thomson Cowper Scott she would buy them all over and over again she would buy up every copy I believe to prevent their falling into unworthy hands and she would have every book that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree,-458.3990000000001
They walked off followed in half a minute by Mr Knightley,-106.54100000000001
But ah,-15.350000000000001
The shame he answered is all mine or ought to be,-101.05499999999999
my sins my sins And I had plenty all the while in my pocket One of my senseless tricks I deserve to be under a continual blush all the rest of my life Well sitting down again go on what else,-372.403
Nobody doubts it and I hope you do not think I am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and pleasures as myself,-245.215
She gave a moment s recollection as they hurried along to the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed earlier in the morning,-217.59100000000007
She hoped no one could have said to her How could you be so unfeeling to your father I must I will tell you truths while I can,-238.108
Lady Middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all the year round while Sir John s independent employments were in existence only half the time,-277.334
His age is only so much beyond hers as to be an advantage as to make his character and principles fixed and his disposition I am well convinced is exactly the very one to make your sister happy,-338.722
Nonsense,-16.607
Oh no as to leaving the little boy both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm to bear the thought and Anne in the joy of the escape could not help adding her warm protestations to theirs,-365.1140000000001
He is not at all a well bred young man,-86.471
He told me every thing his circumstances and plans and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage,-188.787
The intelligence which had been so anxiously announced to her she was now to be anxiously announcing to another,-171.76099999999997
Her insipidity was invariable for even her spirits were always the same and though she did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband provided every thing were conducted in style and her two eldest children attended her she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she might have experienced in sitting at home and so little did her presence add to the pleasure of the others by any share in their conversation that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys,-869.0669999999994
She was first called to observe and approve him farther by a reflection which Elinor chanced one day to make on the difference between him and his sister,-252.468
Edward was the first to speak and it was to notice Marianne s altered looks and express his fear of her not finding London agree with her,-233.42700000000002
It did assist for though he began with grave looks and short questions he was soon led on to talk of them all in the usual way and to take the child out of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity,-367.10800000000006
for shame,-20.955
The others will be here presently,-59.101
That is what I like that is what a young man ought to be,-113.449
Elinor had met his eye and looked conscious likewise,-90.696
But here you are in Bath and the object is to be established here with all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to Sir Walter Elliot,-245.38299999999998
Seldom very seldom does complete truth belong to any human disclosure seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised or a little mistaken but where as in this case though the conduct is mistaken the feelings are not it may not be very material Mr Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart than she possessed or a heart more disposed to accept of his,-633.3840000000002
Mr Elliot had called repeatedly had dined with them once evidently delighted by the distinction of being asked for they gave no dinners in general delighted in short by every proof of cousinly notice and placing his whole happiness in being on intimate terms in Camden Place,-461.77899999999994
Mr and Mrs Musgrove cannot think it wrong while I remain with him,-115.40599999999999
What she was must be uncertain but who she was might be found out and setting aside the 10 000 l it did not appear that she was at all Harriet s superior,-283.049
I should never be out if they were all Sophys or something of that sort,-120.851
I think her the very worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have,-120.10200000000002
It appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature,-108.98500000000001
Charles is out shooting,-43.945
It was her very particular friend you know,-66.42899999999999
I would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible,-112.62299999999999
I am afraid there had been some mistake and I wish you particularly to assure Captain Harville and Captain Wentworth that we hope to see them both,-238.20699999999997
And as to my poor word success which you quarrel with I do not know that I am so entirely without any claim to it,-215.29100000000003
He had in fact though his sisters were now doing all they could for him by calling him poor Richard been nothing better than a thick headed unfeeling unprofitable Dick Musgrove who had never done anything to entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name living or dead,-466.98799999999994
He got up and moved away,-60.394
Mrs Jennings however assured him directly that she should not stand upon ceremony for they were all cousins or something like it and she should certainly wait on Mrs John Dashwood very soon and bring her sisters to see her,-361.05500000000006
Nay the longer they were together the more doubtful seemed the nature of his regard and sometimes for a few painful minutes she believed it to be no more than friendship,-275.816
She was a benevolent charitable good woman and capable of strong attachments most correct in her conduct strict in her notions of decorum and with manners that were held a standard of good breeding,-338.94200000000006
She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith s conversation but she found her altogether very engaging not inconveniently shy not unwilling to talk and yet so far from pushing shewing so proper and becoming a deference seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to Hartfield and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to that she must have good sense and deserve encouragement,-753.5909999999997
My brother and sister will be enchanted with this place,-84.527
I should like it of all things was not plainer in words than manner,-112.13699999999997
Colonel Brandon give ME a living Can it be possible,-103.433
Don t you Mr,-40.936
I am not saying that she did not err in her advice,-93.71199999999997
You must not talk so Marianne,-53.041999999999994
Its character as a ball room caught him and instead of passing on he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed windows which were open to look in and contemplate its capabilities and lament that its original purpose should have ceased,-421.0340000000001
A bowing acquaintance,-27.786
Elton,-9.939
This present from the Campbells said she this pianoforte is very kindly given,-125.83400000000002
You must take care of yourself Mrs,-65.387
With a hasty exclamation of Misery and a sign to her sister not to follow her she directly got up and hurried out of the room,-228.61499999999998
And take it altogether now that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge there is not one that we like better than this,-252.819
What is before me I see,-51.325
His quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy expression and even when he might have determined not to look she was confident that he was often listening,-310.033
No one made any objection but Marianne who with her usual inattention to the forms of general civility exclaimed Your Ladyship will have the goodness to excuse ME you know I detest cards,-315.552
She observed in a low voice to her mother that they were probably going down to Mr Pratt s near Plymouth,-197.099
I wonder what it can be,-48.48599999999999
You are afraid of giving me trouble but I assure you my dear Jane the Campbells can hardly be more interested about you than I am,-236.44299999999998
We must go for the Westons come to us next week you know,-120.91099999999999
But suspicion of something unpleasant is the inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessed in him,-183.043
I always regret excessively on dear Emma s account that she cannot be more at Highbury but now their daughter is married I suppose Colonel and Mrs Campbell will not be able to part with her at all,-330.5510000000001
This set the matter beyond a doubt,-67.715
Do let me hear what she says,-70.682
It would not be fair and yet you ought to have proof for what is all this but assertion and you shall have proof,-204.42499999999998
Emma scarcely heard what was said Her mind was divided between two ideas her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax and poor Harriet and for some time she could only exclaim and require confirmation repeated confirmation,-366.24699999999996
Poor Edward,-22.862000000000002
She then broke the lace off short and dexterously throwing it into a ditch was presently obliged to entreat them to stop and acknowledged her inability to put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort,-380.4080000000002
I think on the contrary when people shut themselves up entirely from society it is a very bad thing and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in a proper degree without living in it either too much or too little,-403.442
Our part of London is very superior to most others You must not confound us with London in general my dear sir,-203.137
Nothing wanting,-25.71
But instead of having any thing to do instead of having any profession chosen for me or being allowed to chuse any myself I returned home to be completely idle and for the first twelvemonth afterwards I had not even the nominal employment which belonging to the university would have given me for I was not entered at Oxford till I was nineteen,-560.0570000000001
Yes a great while ever since my sister married He was a particular friend of Sir John s,-163.44999999999996
Dear Emma bears every thing so well said her father,-98.01299999999999
There is something so shocking in a child s being taken away from his parents and natural home,-170.644
I met the letters in my way this morning and seeing my son s hand presumed to open it though it was not directed to me it was to Mrs Weston,-265.381
Ay that we shall,-40.438
The possibility of the young man s coming to Mrs Goddard s that morning and meeting with Harriet and pleading his own cause gave alarming ideas,-235.2
Was it impossible No Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in understanding but he had been very much struck with the loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner and all the probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour For Harriet it would be advantageous and delightful indeed,-482.542
Captain Benwick came not however,-49.842000000000006
You must promise me not to sit up,-72.69999999999999
Certainly he is not like Mr Knightley,-62.06999999999999
Mr Elton was only too happy,-52.369
You and I Emma will venture to take the part of the poor husband,-115.966
Elinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention in her power and she would have tried to sooth and tranquilize her still more had not Marianne entreated her with all the eagerness of the most nervous irritability not to speak to her for the world,-366.53000000000014
Fanny rejoicing in her escape and proud of the ready wit that had procured it wrote the next morning to Lucy to request her company and her sister s for some days in Harley Street as soon as Lady Middleton could spare them,-402.651
I do not believe said Mrs Dashwood with a good humoured smile that Mr Willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of MY daughters towards what you call CATCHING him,-292.58500000000004
Anne found Captain Benwick again drawing near her,-82.193
He was often hoping intending to come but was always prevented,-107.994
Pain is no expiation,-27.912
A whole evening of back gammon with her father was felicity to it,-109.355
She is very timid and silent,-46.915000000000006
My dear Jane say no more about it,-72.927
It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell but she really did not seem to feel it,-144.51399999999998
Thank you said he in an accent of deep mortification and not another syllable followed,-149.19299999999998
Our ages were nearly the same and from our earliest years we were playfellows and friends,-159.047
I certainly do forget to think of her said Emma as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend,-195.18800000000005
Marianne sighed out her similar apprehension and Elinor s heart wrung for the feelings of Edward while braving his mother s threats for a woman who could not reward him,-263.131
And in short she said more than her husband could long withstand and as none of the others could oppose when he gave way there was no help for it the change of Mary for Anne was inevitable,-335.7700000000001
Their attention and wit were drawn off to his more fortunate rival and the raillery which the other had incurred before any partiality arose was removed when his feelings began really to call for the ridicule so justly annexed to sensibility,-385.2670000000001
The peace turned him on shore at the very moment and he has been living with us in our little family circle ever since,-226.601
There are not many men who would act as he has done,-112.07
We are not boy and girl to be captiously irritable misled by every moment s inadvertence and wantonly playing with our own happiness,-211.448
As they approached Barton indeed and entered on scenes of which every field and every tree brought some peculiar some painful recollection she grew silent and thoughtful and turning away her face from their notice sat earnestly gazing through the window,-424.34299999999996
She must have found the evening agreeable Mr Knightley because she had Emma,-113.32100000000001
Are you acquainted with Mr Robert Ferrars,-71.675
Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas and hoped by the help of backgammon to get her father tolerably through the evening and be attacked by no regrets but her own,-331.62000000000006
My love you contradict every body said his wife with her usual laugh,-128.71099999999998
He writes like a sensible man replied Emma when she had read the letter,-130.899
Such kind friends you know Miss Woodhouse one must always find agreeable though every body seemed rather fagged after the morning s party,-218.50400000000002
No intercourse with Harriet possible but by note no church for her on Sunday any more than on Christmas Day and no need to find excuses for Mr Elton s absenting himself,-309.31699999999995
It would have been beyond comparison she said the least evil of the two and she would be glad to compound NOW for nothing worse,-212.395
A lady without a family was the very best preserver of furniture in the world,-125.114
You can make little Charles do anything he always minds you at a word,-132.601
No I thank you no certainly not,-62.248
In spite of the mischief of his attentions she owed him gratitude and regard perhaps compassion,-156.383
Take care Margaret,-40.545
And Mrs Perry and the children how are they,-78.52799999999999
We ought to be acquainted with Enscombe and with Mrs Churchill s temper before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do,-226.67399999999998
By his description a good deal like the second size double barrel of mine which you shot with one day round Winthrop,-225.23000000000005
Her manners were by no means so elegant as her sister s but they were much more prepossessing,-155.76
I am sure of having their opinions with me,-77.11199999999998
Mr Palmer is so droll,-50.472
We want only two more to be just the right number,-100.82999999999998
Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell,-88.84300000000002
This very awkward history of Mr Elliot was still after an interval of several years felt with anger by Elizabeth who had liked the man for himself and still more for being her father s heir and whose strong family pride could see only in him a proper match for Sir Walter Elliot s eldest daughter,-531.863
The charm of Kellynch and of Lady Elliot all faded away,-94.9
I wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it,-108.712
She paused and added in a low voice If I could but know HIS heart everything would become easy,-189.486
It is fit that the fortune should be on his side for I think the merit will be all on hers,-177.71600000000004
You must be very much altered indeed since we parted if that could be the case and you not there,-172.77499999999998
Was he at all such as he appears now,-81.315
But if he marries a very ignorant vulgar woman certainly I had better not visit her if I can help it,-193.50200000000004
It was not lost on me,-50.099999999999994
There was no bearing such an always and to break through her dreadful gratitude Emma made the direct inquiry of,-190.929
and by the means of this continual though gentle vent was able not only to see the Miss Dashwoods from the first without the smallest emotion but very soon to see them without recollecting a word of the matter and having thus supported the dignity of her own sex and spoken her decided censure of what was wrong in the other she thought herself at liberty to attend to the interest of her own assemblies and therefore determined though rather against the opinion of Sir John that as Mrs Willoughby would at once be a woman of elegance and fortune to leave her card with her as soon as she married,-954.7689999999998
The case you see is but this is quite between ourselves I did not mention a syllable of it in the other room,-199.521
No sir she replied with firmness I shall NOT stay,-104.85300000000001
I am sure William Larkins will not like it,-84.14
Disappointed however and vexed as she was and sometimes displeased with his uncertain behaviour to herself she was very well disposed on the whole to regard his actions with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications which had been rather more painfully extorted from her for Willoughby s service by her mother,-454.3620000000001
But he talked of flannel waistcoats said Marianne and with me a flannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches cramps rheumatisms and every species of ailment that can afflict the old and the feeble,-271.2830000000001
I wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour,-99.33999999999999
Mrs Dashwood smiled and said nothing,-54.84
I could not go away you know because of the rain but I did so wish myself anywhere in the world but there Oh,-204.25200000000004
said Anne suddenly struck by an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging,-152.64700000000002
But he was careless and immethodical like other men about those things and when I came to examine his papers I found it with others still more trivial from different people scattered here and there while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed,-436.67600000000004
He was invited on good faith,-59.685
Mrs Jennings who had been inclined from the first to think Marianne s complaint more serious than Elinor now looked very grave on Mr Harris s report and confirming Charlotte s fears and caution urged the necessity of her immediate removal with her infant and Mr Palmer though treating their apprehensions as idle found the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great to be withstood,-618.5289999999999
She wanted to hear much more than Mary had communicated,-93.212
I have crossed the Atlantic four times and have been once to the East Indies and back again and only once besides being in different places about home Cork and Lisbon and Gibraltar,-300.971
They could not listen to her description of him,-74.95700000000001
How she should begin how she should express herself in her note to Edward was now all her concern,-168.961
Churchill s state however as many were ready to remind her was liable to such sudden variation as might disappoint her nephew in the most reasonable dependence and Mrs Weston was at last persuaded to believe or to say that it must be by some attack of Mrs Churchill that he was prevented coming Emma looked at Harriet while the point was under consideration she behaved very well and betrayed no emotion,-667.164
I see her instrument is open,-53.818999999999996
She saw nothing of the Willoughbys nothing of Edward and for some time nothing of anybody who could by any chance whether grave or gay be interesting to her,-251.28000000000006
Lord,-13.148
As Harriet described it there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour,-195.935
And your mother has brought on herself a most appropriate punishment,-103.049
How they could be thrown together and by what attraction Robert could be drawn on to marry a girl of whose beauty she had herself heard him speak without any admiration a girl too already engaged to his brother and on whose account that brother had been thrown off by his family it was beyond her comprehension to make out,-549.3030000000001
Mamma how shall we do without her,-68.304
His heart was softened in seeing mine suffer and so much of his ill will was done away that when we parted he almost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an old promise about a pointer puppy,-387.20000000000005
Irish I dare say,-43.653000000000006
Your feelings are singular,-37.838
I suppose however on recollection that the case may probably be THIS,-116.57
Though aware before she began it that it must bring a confession of his inconstancy and confirm their separation for ever she was not aware that such language could be suffered to announce it nor could she have supposed Willoughby capable of departing so far from the appearance of every honourable and delicate feeling so far from the common decorum of a gentleman as to send a letter so impudently cruel a letter which instead of bringing with his desire of a release any professions of regret acknowledged no breach of faith denied all peculiar affection whatever a letter of which every line was an insult and which proclaimed its writer to be deep in hardened villainy,-1114.741
It was almost enough to spread purification and perfume all the way,-95.64500000000001
My esteem for your whole family is very sincere but if I have been so unfortunate as to give rise to a belief of more than I felt or meant to express I shall reproach myself for not having been more guarded in my professions of that esteem,-440.0440000000001
At last we are alone,-52.888999999999996
Yes simpleton as I was but I am quite ashamed of it now and wish I could forget as easily as I can burn them,-209.97199999999998
But I have not known him long and he is not a man I think to be known intimately soon,-161.498
How can you think of dirt with such objects before you,-103.564
There was intimacy between them and Mr Cole had heard from Mr Elton since his going away,-156.817
I perfectly understand Mr Robinson s directions and have no fears and indeed Mary I cannot wonder at your husband,-182.84500000000003
Her sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless,-85.43199999999999
When one is in great pain you know one cannot feel any blessing quite as it may deserve,-169.35500000000002
Behold him there the monarch of the seas,-81.0
She asked no more questions therefore merely employed her own fancy and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money concern something just come to light of a disagreeable nature in the circumstances of the family something which the late event at Richmond had brought forward,-481.1230000000001
In the course of a second visit she talked with great openness and Anne s astonishment increased,-160.33399999999997
It did not surprise but it grieved Anne to observe that Elizabeth would not know him,-141.88099999999997
My interference was quite as likely to do harm as good,-102.86399999999999
There were three others Jane says which they hesitated about some time,-124.077
said he,-15.422
It is so cold so very cold and looks and feels so very much like snow that if it were to any other place or with any other party I should really try not to go out to day and dissuade my father from venturing but as he has made up his mind and does not seem to feel the cold himself I do not like to interfere as I know it would be so great a disappointment to Mr and Mrs Weston,-714.3369999999999
This is three times as large And you have never any odd humours my dear,-149.703
I always think that no mutual,-52.998999999999995
Think then what I must have endured in hearing it bandied between the Eltons with all the vulgarity of needless repetition and all the insolence of imaginary superiority,-261.995
said I it is Miss Woodhouse I am sure you will like to see her,-117.14799999999998
yes and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance,-82.007
It is certainly an unpleasant thing replied Mr Dashwood to have those kind of yearly drains on one s income,-186.95400000000004
my dear but so much as Patty has to do And it is a kindness to employ our men,-170.03099999999998
With insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every body s feelings with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every body s destiny,-258.195
I have only to add my dear Willoughby that at Barton cottage you will always be welcome for I will not press you to return here immediately because you only can judge how far THAT might be pleasing to Mrs Smith and on this head I shall be no more disposed to question your judgment than to doubt your inclination,-545.16
A surgeon,-26.183999999999997
The dinner was a grand one the servants were numerous and every thing bespoke the Mistress s inclination for show and the Master s ability to support it,-247.987
It was no longer in Emma s power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures,-135.725
Have a little mercy on the poor men,-79.897
Whenever I looked towards the past I saw some duty neglected or some failing indulged,-164.16
I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy said Mr Knightley presently though I have kept my thoughts to myself but I now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet,-306.67000000000013
She believed he was reckoned a very fine young man,-93.928
It was not in her nature,-45.313
you forget yourself you take me for my friend any message to Miss Smith I shall be happy to deliver but no more of this to me if you please,-252.79800000000003
You saw her answer you wrote her answer too,-84.451
Charles Musgrove was civil and agreeable in sense and temper he was undoubtedly superior to his wife but not of powers or conversation or grace to make the past as they were connected together at all a dangerous contemplation though at the same time Anne could believe with Lady Russell that a more equal match might have greatly improved him and that a woman of real understanding might have given more consequence to his character and more usefulness rationality and elegance to his habits and pursuits,-786.851
He very handsomely hopes they will be happy together and there is nothing very unforgiving in that I think,-151.80800000000002
cried Mrs Jennings I am sure he should be very welcome to bed and board at my house and so I would tell him if I could see him,-244.41999999999996
I do not pretend to be a wit,-66.643
Her Bath habits made evening parties perfectly natural to her and Maple Grove had given her a taste for dinners,-201.23899999999998
No said he smiling that is no subject of regret at all,-104.304
His attentive deference to her father contrasted with his former language was odious and when she thought of his cruel conduct towards Mrs Smith she could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness or the sound of his artificial good sentiments,-431.86800000000005
He was proud of his conquest proud of tricking Edward and very proud of marrying privately without his mother s consent,-201.975
And what inclines one less to bear she has no fair pretence of family or blood,-151.82900000000004
True sir and Emma because she had Miss Fairfax,-85.114
What can it possibly be,-46.745999999999995
When is she dejected or melancholy,-53.349000000000004
He dared not come to Bartlett s Buildings for fear of detection and though their mutual impatience to meet was not to be told they could do nothing at present but write,-289.81600000000003
I am sure a month ago I had no more idea myself The strangest things do take place,-164.223
Between these two she could want no possible attendance by day or night,-134.64299999999997
To youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma s though under temporary gloom at night the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of spirits,-264.343
Pray say no more,-39.481
It was a gentleman it was Colonel Brandon himself,-77.224
She had heard nothing of him since her leaving London nothing new of his plans nothing certain even of his present abode,-209.232
And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess I pity you I thought you cleverer for depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck,-284.30799999999994
It is what we happily have never known any thing of but it must be a life of misery,-161.69199999999998
He liked very much to have his friends come and see him and from various united causes from his long residence at Hartfield and his good nature from his fortune his house and his daughter he could command the visits of his own little circle in a great measure as he liked,-471.13200000000006
By his own marriage likewise which happened soon afterwards he added to his wealth,-142.9
After clearing his throat however he proceeded thus,-94.91
You do not go to town on horseback do you,-89.574
how do you think I can live poking by myself I who have been always used till this winter to have Charlotte with me,-211.71900000000005
She wished however to see the Crofts and was glad to be within when the visit was returned,-151.519
I think Edward said Mrs Dashwood as they were at breakfast the last morning you would be a happier man if you had any profession to engage your time and give an interest to your plans and actions,-337.175
I am sorry to find my love that my father does not think you looking well but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued,-233.24699999999996
Her kind compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow sick and reduced seemed to have quite delighted Mr Elliot,-189.031
This was broken by Willoughby who said with a faint smile It is folly to linger in this manner,-184.63500000000002
If it would be good to her I am sure it would be evil to himself a very shameful and degrading connexion,-188.87000000000003
one never thinks of married men s being beaux they have something else to do,-142.272
By doing it I shall feel that I am near you,-97.96799999999999
Choice how do you mean,-42.644000000000005
He could hardly suppose I should neglect them,-76.34700000000001
Mrs Ferrars not aware of their being Elinor s work particularly requested to look at them and after they had received gratifying testimony of Lady Middletons s approbation Fanny presented them to her mother considerately informing her at the same time that they were done by Miss Dashwood,-441.03400000000005
The only way of proving it however will be to turn to our maps,-120.49099999999999
They were a couple worth looking at,-68.09100000000001
It will do you good to speak of your distress whatever it may be,-119.32300000000001
and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things,-99.451
How well you put it on so gratified,-74.059
For my companion tells me said she that I absolutely promised Miss Bates last night that I would come this morning,-200.856
This was very wonderful if it were true and Lady Russell was in a state of very agreeable curiosity and perplexity about Mr Elliot already recanting the sentiment she had so lately expressed to Mary of his being a man whom she had no wish to see,-409.99300000000017
However I have determined I think I am right I think you ought to be made acquainted with Mr Elliot s real character,-200.906
But you should tell them of the letter my dear said her father,-107.567
I felt that she was infinitely dearer to me than any other woman in the world and that I was using her infamously,-188.397
She felt that in quitting Donwell he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits that in living constantly with her father and in no house of his own there would be much very much to be borne with,-372.822
How many days was it my dear between the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together in our lodgings at North Yarmouth,-241.31399999999996
My greatest danger perhaps in housekeeping may be quite the other way in doing too much and being too careless of expense,-213.27899999999997
Courtship a very good hint,-42.045
He coloured and stammered out an unintelligible reply,-73.074
CHAPTER 28,-17.958
after taking her all over Allenham House and fixing on the very rooms they were to live in hereafter,-183.679
Two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the over throw of every thing,-155.661
He stopt a moment for recollection and then with another sigh went on,-125.06700000000001
With difficulty however could she prevent her from following him herself and to persuade her to check her agitation to wait at least with the appearance of composure till she might speak to him with more privacy and more effect was impossible for Marianne continued incessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery of her feelings by exclamations of wretchedness,-554.2310000000002
But Mr Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits not at all to confuse his intellects,-159.58700000000002
She felt the loss of Willoughby s character yet more heavily than she had felt the loss of his heart his seduction and desertion of Miss Williams the misery of that poor girl and the doubt of what his designs might ONCE have been on herself preyed altogether so much on her spirits that she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt even to Elinor and brooding over her sorrows in silence gave more pain to her sister than could have been communicated by the most open and most frequent confession of them,-822.106
If you prefer Mr Martin to every other person if you think him the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with why should you hesitate,-255.45000000000002
The news of his cousins Anne s engagement burst on Mr Elliot most unexpectedly,-141.26100000000002
Edward is very amiable and I love him tenderly,-83.66199999999999
Mr Woodhouse came in and very soon led to the subject again by the recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of Well my dears how does your book go on Have you got any thing fresh,-331.888
I hope you will be a great deal at Combe Magna,-101.21500000000002
Lady Russell felt this break up of the family exceedingly,-98.95700000000001
On HER measures depended those of her two friends Mrs Jennings could not quit Cleveland during the Dashwoods stay and Colonel Brandon was soon brought by their united request to consider his own abode there as equally determinate if not equally indispensable,-429.242
He would be as little incumbrance as possible to Captain and Mrs Harville but as to leaving his sister in such a state he neither ought nor would,-233.53000000000003
Can you be,-27.099000000000004
After an hour or two spent in what her mother called comfortable chat or in other words in every variety of inquiry concerning all their acquaintance on Mrs Jennings s side and in laughter without cause on Mrs Palmer s it was proposed by the latter that they should all accompany her to some shops where she had business that morning to which Mrs Jennings and Elinor readily consented as having likewise some purchases to make themselves and Marianne though declining it at first was induced to go likewise,-829.7429999999998
I hardly looked at him I was looking at the horses but I think he had something of the Elliot countenance I wonder the arms did not strike me,-248.03500000000003
I always say we are quite blessed in our neighbours My dear sir if there is one thing my mother loves better than another it is pork a roast loin of pork,-323.79200000000003
Perhaps indifferent if indifference could exist under such circumstances,-102.523
She was good enough for Mr Elton no doubt accomplished enough for Highbury handsome enough to look plain probably by Harriet s side,-219.856
Mrs Weston capital in her country dances was seated and beginning an irresistible waltz and Frank Churchill coming up with most becoming gallantry to Emma had secured her hand and led her up to the top,-345.969
Well pretty good news is not it,-64.565
His father was rendered easy by such an assurance and Mr John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there might prudently be in his power to do for them,-276.8590000000001
CHAPTER VIII,-28.290999999999997
Mr Weston had accompanied her to Mrs Bates s and gone through his share of this essential attention most handsomely but she having then induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing was now returned with much more to say and much more to say with satisfaction than a quarter of an hour spent in Mrs Bates s parlour with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings could have afforded,-631.152
Emma could not but feel all this and then her face her features there was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered it was not regular but it was very pleasing beauty,-296.209
Even if he did not come to Camden Place himself it would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence by Captain Harville,-228.83
Men are very safe with us let them be ever so rich,-119.881
She could have made an inquiry or two as to the expedition and the expense of the Irish mails it was at her tongue s end but she abstained,-233.433
But perhaps he may never have heard of there being such a creature in the world,-135.08899999999997
Though WE have not known him long he is no stranger in this part of the world and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage,-231.03000000000006
He understood that she was in need of a dwelling and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage he assured her that everything should be done to it which she might think necessary if the situation pleased her,-358.40300000000013
All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject but I believed none of it,-149.339
He was here only a quarter of an hour and in a state of agitation which did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay but that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said,-327.86800000000005
You may see the end of the house,-65.397
I have some hope resumed he of my uncle s being persuaded to pay a visit at Randalls he wants to be introduced to her,-221.88199999999998
They meant to take a long drive this morning perhaps we may hail them from some of these hills,-181.08799999999997
She still screamed and sobbed lustily kicked her two brothers for offering to touch her and all their united soothings were ineffectual till Lady Middleton luckily remembering that in a scene of similar distress last week some apricot marmalade had been successfully applied for a bruised temple the same remedy was eagerly proposed for this unfortunate scratch and a slight intermission of screams in the young lady on hearing it gave them reason to hope that it would not be rejected She was carried out of the room therefore in her mother s arms in quest of this medicine and as the two boys chose to follow though earnestly entreated by their mother to stay behind the four young ladies were left in a quietness which the room had not known for many hours,-1240.7899999999997
Captain Harville was no reader but he had contrived excellent accommodations and fashioned very pretty shelves for a tolerable collection of well bound volumes the property of Captain Benwick,-277.534
Why don t he in such a case sell his horses let his house turn off his servants and make a thorough reform at once,-247.01899999999995
When the weather is settled and I have recovered my strength said she we will take long walks together every day,-199.55000000000004
Mr Perry said he in a voice of very strong displeasure would do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for,-209.83500000000004
But he laughed so heartily at the recollection that Emma could not help saying,-130.036
Their affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough to make a very creditable appearance in Mr Gray s shop,-192.755
When I think of the kindness and favour I have met with of her excellence and patience and my uncle s generosity I am mad with joy but when I recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her and how little I deserve to be forgiven I am mad with anger,-451.1450000000001
On this article I can fully acquit him,-88.01000000000002
I was introducing her into good company and giving her the opportunity of pleasing some one worth having I ought not to have attempted more,-221.61099999999996
For some moments her voice was lost but recovering herself she added and with greater calmness than before I am now perfectly satisfied I wish for no change,-266.691
He would look for her he would find her out before the evening were over and at present perhaps it was as well to be asunder,-214.639
Mrs Dashwood looked at Elinor with surprise,-65.328
Margaret related something to her the next day which placed this matter in a still clearer light,-169.542
The shortness of his visit the steadiness of his purpose in leaving them originated in the same fettered inclination the same inevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother,-258.58500000000004
When do you write to Colonel Brandon ma am,-88.654
No not if it were to be by the side of Barton covert and they were kept watching for two hours together,-186.421
Perfection should not have come quite so soon,-65.647
You will be perfectly safe you know among your friends,-96.453
In this style she ran on never thoroughly stopped by any thing till Mr Woodhouse came into the room her vanity had then a change of object and Emma heard her saying in the same half whisper to Jane,-360.5730000000001
It had been my doing solely mine,-72.842
Your interest Sir Walter is in pretty safe hands,-96.01800000000001
I should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty and she would have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and refinement But I had no choice,-255.68000000000004
When I found he was really going to his friends at Thornberry Park for the whole day to morrow I had compassion on him,-204.339
Mr Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in,-217.95200000000006
Ah no have you forgot what passed in town That infamous letter Did she shew it you,-160.617
What did you hear,-37.624
I hope I know better now than to care for Mr Martin or to be suspected of it,-147.58599999999998
Edward tried to return her kindness as it deserved but before such witnesses he dared not say half what he really felt,-199.876
Not that I think Mr Martin would ever marry any body but what had had some education and been very well brought up,-204.94799999999998
Dancing with open windows I am sure neither your father nor Mrs Weston poor Miss Taylor that was would suffer it,-196.351
She was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke and opening the casement there immediately called Mr Knightley s attention and every syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others as if it had passed within the same apartment,-393.00199999999995
I like old friends and Miss Jane Fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady a very pretty and a very well behaved young lady indeed,-240.64099999999996
She said no more other subjects took their turn and the rest of the dinner passed away the dessert succeeded the children came in and were talked to and admired amid the usual rate of conversation a few clever things said a few downright silly but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor the other nothing worse than everyday remarks dull repetitions old news and heavy jokes,-652.9380000000002
The power of disappointing them it was true must always be her s,-112.51799999999999
Robert s offence was unpardonable but Lucy s was infinitely worse,-113.508
Being very sure I have long lost your affections I have thought myself at liberty to bestow my own on another and have no doubt of being as happy with him as I once used to think I might be with you but I scorn to accept a hand while the heart was another s,-470.158
Then changing from a frown to a smile No do not tell me I do not want to know what you mean Where is my father When are we to begin dancing,-289.495
After a short pause,-42.641
My poor mother does not know how to bear it,-90.81800000000001
Mrs Clay s affections had overpowered her interest and she had sacrificed for the young man s sake the possibility of scheming longer for Sir Walter,-237.42499999999998
A great many things I assure you,-66.583
You and Miss Smith and Miss Fairfax will be three and the two Miss Coxes five and for five couple there will be plenty of room,-233.68599999999998
She had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate,-79.315
I have only to hope that they may be proportionately short,-85.499
Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her,-92.838
It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it said the young man though there are not many houses that I should presume on so far but in coming home I felt I might do any thing,-344.96
my dear it is quite understood I give you my word,-96.00200000000001
My mother s are really very good indeed,-74.348
It is impossible,-28.209
Mr Weston had been so very earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came that she could not refuse him and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man s company,-535.364
Not at all,-27.401
Her mind did become settled but it was settled in a gloomy dejection,-131.34799999999998
He came back gay and self satisfied eager and busy caring nothing for Miss Woodhouse and defying Miss Smith,-188.37199999999999
I shall never see her if she goes by London,-90.146
When he gave his promise to his father he meditated within himself to increase the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousand pounds a piece,-260.65799999999996
The necessity of concealing from her mother and Marianne what had been entrusted in confidence to herself though it obliged her to unceasing exertion was no aggravation of Elinor s distress,-275.23900000000003
I warrant you Miss Marianne would have been ready to wait till matters came round,-145.352
And had you really some at hand yourself,-73.761
The sitting began and Harriet smiling and blushing and afraid of not keeping her attitude and countenance presented a very sweet mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist,-316.471
I did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley Street last Tuesday and very much regretted that I was not fortunate enough to find yourselves and Mrs Jennings at home,-277.50300000000004
The cottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home many more of his hours were spent there than at Allenham and if no general engagement collected them at the park the exercise which called him out in the morning was almost certain of ending there where the rest of the day was spent by himself at the side of Marianne and by his favourite pointer at her feet,-645.9669999999998
It was forwarded to me from Delaford and I received it on the very morning of our intended party to Whitwell and this was the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly which I am sure must at the time have appeared strange to every body and which I believe gave offence to some,-461.59800000000007
Elizabeth had nothing to propose of deeper efficacy,-85.555
A few moments reflection however produced a very happy idea and she exclaimed,-130.21699999999998
Elliot,-10.322
And so ma am all these thing considered said Mrs Musgrove in her powerful whisper though we could have wished it different yet altogether we did not think it fair to stand out any longer for Charles Hayter was quite wild about it and Henrietta was pretty near as bad and so we thought they had better marry at once and make the best of it as many others have done before them,-672.621
Emma was almost too much astonished to answer but Mrs Elton hardly waited for the affirmative before she went on,-177.93200000000002
But there are other points to be considered besides his inclination,-107.24099999999999
She even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find that Elinor and her sister were so soon to leave town as she had hoped to see more of them an exertion in which her husband who attended her into the room and hung enamoured over her accents seemed to distinguish every thing that was most affectionate and graceful,-517.0070000000001
Harriet was silent,-27.911
She was full of jokes and laughter and before dinner was over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers and husbands hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in Sussex and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not,-432.59700000000004
Her first communication had reached no farther than to state the fact of the engagement and the length of time it had existed Marianne s feelings had then broken in and put an end to all regularity of detail and for some time all that could be done was to soothe her distress lessen her alarms and combat her resentment,-530.984
I hope I am as fond of my child as any mother but I do not know that I am of any more use in the sick room than Charles for I cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill and you saw this morning that if I told him to keep quiet he was sure to begin kicking about,-533.767
I do not understand what you mean by interrupting them said Elinor you were all in the same room together were not you,-195.90300000000002
As to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely to fall to impede their return that was a mere joke he was afraid they would find no difficulty,-282.74199999999996
And indeed to own the truth I do not think nurse in her heart is a very strenuous opposer of Sir Walter s making a second match,-228.13799999999998
With her children they were in continual raptures extolling their beauty courting their notice and humouring their whims and such of their time as could be spared from the importunate demands which this politeness made on it was spent in admiration of whatever her ladyship was doing if she happened to be doing any thing or in taking patterns of some elegant new dress in which her appearance the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight,-715.8449999999998
Her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess who had fallen little short of a mother in affection,-362.336
How is your niece Miss Bates I want to inquire after you all but particularly your niece,-164.082
Elinor had seen so little of Mr Palmer and in that little had seen so much variety in his address to her sister and herself that she knew not what to expect to find him in his own family,-319.71400000000006
Charles was to return to Lyme the same afternoon and his father had at first half a mind to go with him but the ladies could not consent,-235.977
You divert me against my conscience,-57.309
VOLUME I,-22.499
Their attention to our comfort their friendliness in every particular is more than I can express,-155.053
Enscombe is in Yorkshire,-42.498999999999995
He had wanted very much to go abroad had been very eager indeed to be allowed to travel but she would not hear of it,-211.945
He came to the part of the room where the sitters by were collected spoke to some and walked about in front of them as if to shew his liberty and his resolution of maintaining it,-307.2200000000001
Mary was in excellent spirits enjoying the gaiety and the change and so well satisfied with the journey in her mother in law s carriage with four horses and with her own complete independence of Camden Place that she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought and enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house as they were detailed to her,-584.644
I shall never forget his happiness,-56.19200000000001
I am afraid none at all,-53.998999999999995
Can you really,-30.991
If Mr and Mrs Weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning we may talk it over and see what can be done,-227.23600000000002
She had only meant to oppose the too common idea of spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other not at all to represent Captain Benwick s manners as the very best that could possibly be and after a little hesitation she was beginning to say I was not entering into any comparison of the two friends but the Admiral interrupted her with,-564.1530000000002
The cheeks which had been pale now glowed and the movements which had hesitated were decided,-143.888
They were both so truly respectable in their happiness so disinterested in every sensation thought so much of Jane so much of every body and so little of themselves that every kindly feeling was at work for them,-345.81699999999995
They told me something said Harriet rather hesitatingly but it is nothing of any consequence,-140.29600000000002
Mr Elliot was rational discreet polished but he was not open,-108.80799999999999
Pray come in do come in,-54.697
The rest of the company soon dropt in,-74.00099999999999
Charles and Mary also came in of course during their visit and Mr Musgrove made a point of paying his respects to Lady Russell and sat down close to her for ten minutes talking with a very raised voice but from the clamour of the children on his knees generally in vain,-468.08800000000014
It is a reasonable and laudable pride which resists such malevolence,-88.87199999999999
Elinor needed little observation to perceive that her reserve was a mere calmness of manner with which sense had nothing to do,-202.98899999999998
Dining once with the Coles and having a ball talked of which never took place,-134.011
That was a point which Anne had not been able to avoid suspecting before and instead of drawing the same conclusion as Mary from the present course of events they served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some dawning of tenderness toward herself,-417.1040000000002
Shall I tell you my guess,-60.185
Better accommodations he can promise them and not a less grateful welcome than at Randalls,-151.08199999999997
I hope she does,-33.476
Were it possible she must say it must be Edward,-88.53999999999999
Yes certainly it does,-39.129000000000005
Every body who saw it was pleased but Mr Elton was in continual raptures and defended it through every criticism,-177.516
Yes he replied any body may know how highly I think of her,-114.91299999999998
my dear you are very modest,-56.678999999999995
As to the circumstances of her birth though in a legal sense she may be called Nobody it will not hold in common sense,-221.287
Such a home indeed,-38.587
I only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else,-108.517
What a horrible idea,-43.48500000000001
Something must be done for them whenever they leave Norland and settle in a new home,-153.554
I am sure Lady Russell would like him,-71.585
I must have given you up,-49.426
He had his shepherd s son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her,-150.21
Dear me How should I ever have borne it,-84.289
I felt my luck Admiral I assure you replied Captain Wentworth seriously,-120.53099999999999
But why must she consent to be with the Eltons Here is quite a separate puzzle,-154.30599999999998
You are very kind but I know what my manners were to you So cold and artificial I had always a part to act It was a life of deceit I know that I must have disgusted you,-319.12
I will not oppose such kind politeness but I should be sorry to be examined by a real proficient,-167.809
But this he declined as he was dirty and wet,-94.41900000000001
Money you know coming down with money two daughters at once it cannot be a very agreeable operation and it streightens him as to many things,-228.67300000000003
Those soft blue eyes and all those natural graces should not be wasted on the inferior society of Highbury and its connexions,-231.867
I am very glad indeed my dear to hear she is to be so comfortably settled,-137.13000000000002
She met him with a hand that would be taken and a voice that expressed the affection of a sister,-165.29600000000002
I should always be happy replied Elinor to show any mark of my esteem and friendship for Mr Ferrars but do you not perceive that my interest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary,-322.23
Four years,-26.701
Well said she it must be borne some time or other and it may as well be now,-150.35000000000005
my dear as Perry says where health is at stake nothing else should be considered and if one is to travel there is not much to chuse between forty miles and an hundred Better not move at all better stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to get into a worse air,-530.0560000000002
There are several odd looking men walking about here who I am told are sailors,-162.005
You must allow for an injured angry woman,-84.03
She would not have been puzzled had she dared fix on them,-110.708
I met William Larkins continued Mr Elton as I got near the house and he told me I should not find his master at home but I did not believe him William seemed rather out of humour,-339.55600000000004
My best love of course,-49.352000000000004
I always say there is something direful in the sound but nothing more is positively known of the Tupmans though a good many things I assure you are suspected and yet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to my brother Mr Suckling who happens to be one of their nearest neighbours,-494.24700000000007
She caught every syllable with panting eagerness her hand unknowingly to herself closely pressed her sister s and tears covered her cheeks,-207.859
She had a great wish to see him,-62.842000000000006
To a degree I could contradict this instantly but when I began to reflect that others might have felt the same her own family nay perhaps herself I was no longer at my own disposal,-323.897
Mr Martin is a very respectable young man but I cannot admit him to be Harriet s equal and am rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her,-275.23600000000005
He joined them immediately and with scarcely an invitation seated himself between them,-130.371
He had reached Randalls the evening before,-65.517
Shall I tell you,-39.013
This discovery laid many smaller matters open,-91.03000000000002
Have not you mistaken the day,-54.235
I never had the smallest I assure you,-63.74100000000001
said Elinor reproachfully a note would have answered every purpose Why was it necessary to call,-146.805
He persisted in having loved none but her,-79.82999999999998
I see the difference plain enough,-56.298
And to have entered into a secret engagement with a young man under her uncle s care the son of a woman especially of such very large fortune as Mrs Ferrars is perhaps altogether a little extraordinary,-338.07899999999995
Anne far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure replied I can easily believe it,-132.24099999999999
But so eager and so resolute,-58.33
Her next beginning was,-40.196000000000005
The only thing I do not thoroughly like is that she seems to be sitting out of doors with only a little shawl over her shoulders and it makes one think she must catch cold,-310.496
Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would be very glad to marry him,-132.66
They are some of my very old friends,-71.331
She had long resolved that one and twenty should be the period,-103.80699999999999
The others joined them and it was a group in which Anne found herself also necessarily included,-166.147
The wants and sufferings of the poor family however were the first subject on meeting,-138.545
Difference,-6.274
Voices approached the shop or rather one voice and two ladies Mrs Weston and Miss Bates met them at the door,-193.58799999999997
Yes yes pray pass me added her husband with a sort of sneering consciousness I have nothing to say that can entertain Miss Woodhouse or any other young lady,-270.622
My dear Harriet what do you mean,-65.865
They were sneering and negligent,-45.393
continued Mrs Musgrove he was grown so steady and such an excellent correspondent while he was under your care,-185.82199999999997
As you will do it it will indeed to use your own words be an exquisite possession,-156.31399999999996
And moreover if you must go to the sea it had better not have been to South End,-161.73800000000003
If it failed to produce equal exertion it could not be an equal conviction,-136.065
She had not even a share in his opening compliments Her name was not mentioned and there was so striking a change in all this and such an ill judged solemnity of leave taking in his graceful acknowledgments as she thought at first could not escape her father s suspicion,-462.278
I will say no more about him cried Emma you turn every thing to evil,-131.666
I am come here to bespeak Fanny a seal,-81.914
So then it all came out and the long and the short of the matter by all I can learn seems to be this,-196.977
Emma listened and looked and soon perceived that Frank Churchill s state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of humour,-233.13099999999997
These matters are always a secret till it is found out that every body knows them,-155.78199999999998
Kitty a fair but frozen maid,-73.244
Mrs Elton had undoubtedly the advantage at this time in vanity completely gratified for though she had intended to begin with Frank Churchill she could not lose by the change,-275.004
The next time you write to your good father Miss Elliot pray give him my compliments and Mrs Croft s and say that we are settled here quite to our liking and have no fault at all to find with the place,-376.927
And in a louder steadier tone he concluded with He will soon be gone,-129.673
Emma was gratified to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance,-210.285
They were lucky enough to find Lady Middleton at home and Sir John came in before their visit ended,-183.86800000000002
Elinor laughed,-22.353
She was your governess I think,-53.207
She was seated in her mother s lap covered with kisses her wound bathed with lavender water by one of the Miss Steeles who was on her knees to attend her and her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by the other,-330.765
I only wish replied her sister there were any thing I COULD do which might be of comfort to you,-158.35999999999999
She had not deserved it she had often been negligent or perverse slighting his advice or even wilfully opposing him insensible of half his merits and quarrelling with him because he would not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own but still from family attachment and habit and thorough excellence of mind he had loved her and watched over her from a girl with an endeavour to improve her and an anxiety for her doing right which no other creature had at all shared,-804.2909999999996
One other short call in Harley Street in which Elinor received her brother s congratulations on their travelling so far towards Barton without any expense and on Colonel Brandon s being to follow them to Cleveland in a day or two completed the intercourse of the brother and sisters in town and a faint invitation from Fanny to come to Norland whenever it should happen to be in their way which of all things was the most unlikely to occur with a more warm though less public assurance from John to Elinor of the promptitude with which he should come to see her at Delaford was all that foretold any meeting in the country,-1028.2819999999995
And when she has forgiven you perhaps a little humility may be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement almost as imprudent in HER eyes as the first,-270.218
Mr Elton looked all happiness at this proposition and nothing could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage,-287.10600000000005
He had left the country in consequence,-61.24000000000001
Well my dear I must be gone before I have had half my talk out,-130.405
The conviction seemed real he looked as if he felt it,-100.875
As good a kind of fellow as ever lived I assure you,-108.91199999999999
Do you know any family of that name,-69.689
She paused a few moments,-52.251999999999995
Have you any thing to send or say besides the love which nobody carries,-128.72799999999998
Now this must be very bad for you said he suddenly rousing from a little reverie to be coming and finding us here,-214.24
Elinor first spoke,-30.511000000000003
Mr Woodhouse hesitated Not near so often my dear as I could wish,-125.22200000000001
After this speech he was gone as soon as possible,-92.682
But so little were they anymore than the others inclined to oblige her that if Sir John dined from home she might spend a whole day without hearing any other raillery on the subject than what she was kind enough to bestow on herself,-406.43799999999993
Elton may talk sentimentally but he will act rationally,-89.71600000000001
But when this passed away when her spirits became collected when she saw that to the perfect good breeding of the gentleman he united frankness and vivacity and above all when she heard him declare that of music and dancing he was passionately fond she gave him such a look of approbation as secured the largest share of his discourse to herself for the rest of his stay,-609.9470000000001
She was silent Elinor s security sunk but her self command did not sink with it,-154.829
He knows I have a thorough regard for him and all his family and I believe considers me as one of his best friends,-207.396
A very few days had passed after this adventure when Harriet came one morning to Emma with a small parcel in her hand and after sitting down and hesitating thus began,-293.463
His value for rank and connexion she perceived was greater than hers,-123.85400000000001
Why do you smile,-40.369
It is the garden of England you know,-69.678
She loved every body was interested in every body s happiness quicksighted to every body s merits thought herself a most fortunate creature and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother and so many good neighbours and friends and a home that wanted for nothing,-422.5620000000001
They were never tolerated at Maple Grove,-68.40299999999999
Elinor s marriage divided her as little from her family as could well be contrived without rendering the cottage at Barton entirely useless for her mother and sisters spent much more than half their time with her,-335.52099999999996
Then she had indeed been a pitiable object for she had caught cold on the journey and had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again confined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain and all this among strangers with the absolute necessity of having a regular nurse and finances at that moment particularly unfit to meet any extraordinary expense,-618.3219999999999
Quite wrong my dear aunt there is no likeness at all,-110.634
said she,-15.05
The sight of Mrs Clay in such favour and of Anne so overlooked was a perpetual provocation to her there and vexed her as much when she was away as a person in Bath who drinks the water gets all the new publications and has a very large acquaintance has time to be vexed,-462.66200000000003
Could it be Mr Elliot,-44.67699999999999
My dear friend cried Lucy as soon as they were by themselves I come to talk to you of my happiness,-180.27599999999998
My first doth affliction denote Which my second is destin d to feel And my whole is the best antidote That affliction to soften and heal,-244.187
Mrs Cole has servants to send,-61.755
I am persuaded that Mrs Smith suspects his regard for Marianne disapproves of it perhaps because she has other views for him and on that account is eager to get him away and that the business which she sends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him,-422.81000000000006
This is like giving ourselves a slap to be sure,-87.202
She watched him well,-39.103
He was determined at least not to mar it by an imprudent marriage and I know it was his belief whether justly or not of course I cannot decide that your father and sister in their civilities and invitations were designing a match between the heir and the young lady and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence,-592.475
CHAPTER XVII,-28.290999999999997
Jane desired me to do it so I always do and so I began to day with my usual caution but no sooner did I come to the mention of her being unwell than I burst out quite frightened with Bless me,-373.38500000000005
I am sure I wonder my heart is not quite broke,-99.728
Luckily Lady Middleton s mother had arrived at Barton within the last hour and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman he hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as they might imagine,-340.00600000000003
You provide for the family you know with a smile at his father,-113.80699999999999
Well well I am ready and turning again to Emma but you must not be expecting such a very fine young man you have only had my account you know I dare say he is really nothing extraordinary though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very different conviction,-464.64300000000003
She boldly acknowledged herself flattered and continued her enquiries,-89.59
I was exceedingly pleased to hear that Mrs Ferrars considered it in that light a very gratifying circumstance you know to us all,-203.924
They will be so very happy to see you,-71.72200000000001
Why to be sure said he seeming to recollect himself people have little have very little in their power,-169.79200000000003
My dear Harriet what are you thinking of,-71.595
Elinor with a very heavy heart aware of the pain she was going to communicate and perceiving by Marianne s letter how ill she had succeeded in laying any foundation for it then sat down to write her mother an account of what had passed and entreat her directions for the future while Marianne who came into the drawing room on Mrs Jennings s going away remained fixed at the table where Elinor wrote watching the advancement of her pen grieving over her for the hardship of such a task and grieving still more fondly over its effect on her mother,-952.3819999999996
The very last person whom one should expect to be forgotten My dear Mr E he must have left a message for you I am sure he must Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric and his servants forgot it,-368.80300000000005
It is yet too early in life to despair of such a happiness,-116.759
In spite of her vexation she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous that she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to perform by Harriet which Mrs Weston had just gone through by herself,-345.16400000000004
She looked down as she said this amiably bashful with only one side glance at her companion to observe its effect on her,-202.994
Edward have got some business at Oxford he says so he must go there for a time and after THAT as soon as he can light upon a Bishop he will be ordained,-288.95899999999995
here comes your beau Nancy my cousin said t other day when she saw him crossing the street to the house,-213.596
I am afraid it cannot take place very soon,-81.873
Emma was pleased with the thought and producing the box the table was quickly scattered over with alphabets which no one seemed so much disposed to employ as their two selves,-292.386
She says she is afraid there will be draughts in the passage though every thing has been done One door nailed up Quantities of matting My dear Jane indeed you must,-272.14900000000006
Oh what a sweet house How very beautiful There are the yellow curtains that Miss Nash admires so much,-188.775
Marianne could never love by halves and her whole heart became in time as much devoted to her husband as it had once been to Willoughby,-218.508
Now will be the time,-41.244
Astonished and shocked at so unlover like a speech she was almost ready to cry out Lord,-155.44099999999997
He is in Highbury every now and then and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to Kingston,-191.90600000000003
I thought he meant to try his skill by his manner of declining it yesterday,-140.686
You must have done well,-44.617999999999995
Yes I have called there passing the door I thought it better,-106.91400000000002
I thought you were speaking of some man of property Mr Wentworth was nobody I remember quite unconnected nothing to do with the Strafford family,-208.179
A young woman if she fall into bad hands may be teazed and kept at a distance from those she wants to be with but one cannot comprehend a young man s being under such restraint as not to be able to spend a week with his father if he likes it,-470.40300000000025
She must abide by the evil of having refused him whatever it may be and as to the refusal itself I will not pretend to say that I might not influence her a little but I assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do,-407.5070000000001
She read the concluding lines and was all flutter and happiness,-104.79
cried Sir John what is HE in the country,-86.209
She sometimes endeavoured for a few minutes to read but the book was soon thrown aside and she returned to the more interesting employment of walking backwards and forwards across the room pausing for a moment whenever she came to the window in hopes of distinguishing the long expected rap,-475.36800000000005
She seemed to be in the middle of some eager speech,-96.44800000000001
They were alike too in a general benevolence of temper and a strong habit of regard for every old acquaintance,-189.01100000000002
None I thank you unless you will give me the pleasure of your company the little way our road lies together,-208.24999999999997
Disputable however as might be the taste of such a termination it was in itself a charming walk and the view which closed it extremely pretty The considerable slope at nearly the foot of which the Abbey stood gradually acquired a steeper form beyond its grounds and at half a mile distant was a bank of considerable abruptness and grandeur well clothed with wood and at the bottom of this bank favourably placed and sheltered rose the Abbey Mill Farm with meadows in front and the river making a close and handsome curve around it,-902.065
She received no other answer than an artificial assenting smile followed by a contemptuous glance as he turned away which Anne perfectly knew the meaning of,-255.20300000000006
Well I am so sorry Oh,-55.480999999999995
He had never been an unhappy man his own temper had secured him from that even in his first marriage but his second must shew him how delightful a well judging and truly amiable woman could be and must give him the pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen to excite gratitude than to feel it,-587.0459999999999
He appears rough to you said Emma because you are so very gentle yourself but if you could compare him with other papas you would not think him rough,-264.775
cried Marianne there has been no engagement,-65.799
I thought you had lost half your property at least,-93.287
John Knightley only was in mute astonishment That a man who might have spent his evening quietly at home after a day of business in London should set off again and walk half a mile to another man s house for the sake of being in mixed company till bed time of finishing his day in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers was a circumstance to strike him deeply,-659.2889999999998
They had no conversation together no intercourse but what the commonest civility required,-133.744
At Christmas every body invites their friends about them and people think little of even the worst weather,-170.80400000000003
Emma s going away directly after tea might be giving offence,-112.94900000000001
I am sure I cannot imagine how they will spend half of it and as to your giving them more it is quite absurd to think of it,-233.324
You will not be sorry to find yourself at home,-88.238
And what did the Colonel say,-52.402
I was going to observe sir said Frank Churchill that one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of any body s catching cold so much less danger at the Crown than at Randalls,-358.8589999999999
Were you often in the same society,-66.513
Quite otherwise indeed if I understood Miss Fairfax s opinion last night,-125.18800000000002
She could hardly determine what her own expectation of its event really was though she earnestly tried to drive away the notion of its being possible to end otherwise at last than in the marriage of Edward and Lucy,-359.10299999999995
Ha,-16.192
As soon as she came to her own name it was irresistible every line relating to herself was interesting and almost every line agreeable and when this charm ceased the subject could still maintain itself by the natural return of her former regard for the writer and the very strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her at that moment,-568.5960000000001
She blessed the favouring blindness,-50.018
Do you compare your conduct with his,-68.681
You may well be amazed returned Mrs Weston still averting her eyes and talking on with eagerness that Emma might have time to recover You may well be amazed,-282.40100000000007
said Elinor,-17.6
At last however my resolution was taken and I had determined as soon as I could engage her alone to justify the attentions I had so invariably paid her and openly assure her of an affection which I had already taken such pains to display,-411.42600000000004
Pray excuse me but supposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy it cannot be expected that Emma accountable to nobody but her father who perfectly approves the acquaintance should put an end to it so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself,-426.6900000000002
The wedding over and the bride people gone her father and herself were left to dine together with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening,-259.181
Have you been lately in Sussex,-62.892
He said he should not stay out long but he has never come back and now it is almost one,-172.31700000000004
It was also a very early speculation with Emma,-85.42
Aye that may suit your humble ideas of yourself I know what a modest creature you are but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any thing that may offer any inferior commonplace situation in a family not moving in a certain circle or able to command the elegancies of life,-525.1480000000001
Though now the middle of December there had yet been no weather to prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise and on the morrow Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family who lived a little way out of Highbury,-428.2300000000002
How fast I made money in her,-65.51899999999999
Dinner parties and evening parties were made for him and his lady and invitations flowed in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they were never to have a disengaged day,-282.75000000000006
She was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length by the eagerness of Harriet s wondering questions,-291.163
With such a reward for her tears the child was too wise to cease crying,-150.585
Mr Elton was still talking still engaged in some interesting detail and Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday s party at his friend Cole s and that she was come in herself for the Stilton cheese the north Wiltshire the butter the cellery the beet root and all the dessert,-535.1650000000001
Such a letter could not be read without putting Anne in a glow and Mrs Smith observing the high colour in her face said,-223.76600000000002
Captain Wentworth s eyes were also turned towards her,-90.482
The parties stood thus,-48.641999999999996
or is it equally criminal in every body,-66.257
NOW he felt astonished himself that he had never yet been to the place,-124.026
She would keep the peace if possible and there was something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits the all sufficiency of home to himself whence resulted her brother s disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse and those to whom it was important It had a high claim to forbearance,-516.2100000000002
This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted and Mr Weston has done very well for himself but he must have knocked up every body else,-248.50000000000003
I am very sorry to hear Miss Fairfax of your being out this morning in the rain,-144.946
no and Emma could just catch the words so superior to Mr,-103.33999999999999
Nobody cares for a letter the thing is to be always happy with pleasant companions,-138.076
It is time for us to be going indeed,-74.80199999999999
Might not the evening end in a dance,-75.22
Depend upon it Emma a sensible man would find no difficulty in it,-120.551
Emma had feelings less of curiosity than of pride or propriety to make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects and she made a point of Harriet s going with her that the worst of the business might be gone through as soon as possible,-420.47400000000005
she exclaimed he is there he is there Oh,-76.397
So I said I was very much obliged to him you know I could not do less and then he went back to Elizabeth and I came round by the stables I believe I did but I hardly knew where I was or any thing about it,-379.033
Get up and go over all the rooms in the house if you like it,-120.74399999999999
You should not have suspected me now the case is so different and my age is so different,-160.265
Trust to me,-19.496
One cannot wonder one cannot wonder,-65.65700000000001
Cole,-12.52
It has given me such an abhorrence of annuities that I am sure I would not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world,-251.761
To Mrs Jennings to the Middletons he has been long and intimately known they equally love and respect him and even my own knowledge of him though lately acquired is very considerable and so highly do I value and esteem him that if Marianne can be happy with him I shall be as ready as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing to us in the world,-612.7599999999999
Cannot you my dear Emma cannot you form a guess as to what you are to hear,-150.927
No he thought it very far from an improvement a very bad plan much worse than the other,-164.37300000000002
She spoke to him ordered entreated and insisted in vain,-102.62
Only one more papa only for Mr Elton,-77.59700000000001
You must have seen that I did,-57.638000000000005
Yes a good deal nearer,-51.137
But who else was there to employ,-64.027
The event has proved that I was a cunning fool providing with great circumspection for a possible opportunity of making myself contemptible and wretched for ever,-243.59300000000002
But I have just left Marianne in bed and I hope almost asleep and as I think nothing will be of so much service to her as rest if you will give me leave I will drink the wine myself,-349.06100000000004
In this manner they had continued about a quarter of an hour when Marianne whose nerves could not then bear any sudden noise was startled by a rap at the door,-302.64200000000005
The first error and the worst lay at her door,-95.869
But it is very remarkable that she should always hear Jane better than she does me,-142.55
In one respect perhaps Mr Elton s manners are superior to Mr Knightley s or Mr Weston s,-164.23
About this time the two Miss Steeles lately arrived at their cousin s house in Bartlett s Buildings Holburn presented themselves again before their more grand relations in Conduit and Berkeley Streets and were welcomed by them all with great cordiality,-414.3839999999999
This is very strange sure he need not wait to be older,-113.10399999999998
Fortunately he had a younger brother who was more promising,-99.504
Between them it was more the intimacy of sisters,-80.621
I cannot name a day said he till I have spoken to some others whom I would wish to meet you,-179.68599999999998
She was convinced that Margaret had fixed on a person whose name she could not bear with composure to become a standing joke with Mrs Jennings,-244.20999999999995
So you are come at last,-55.30499999999999
how poor they will be I must see what I can give them towards furnishing their house,-145.88799999999998
Mr Woodhouse was resigned,-40.057
CHAPTER 15,-28.290999999999997
Mrs Elton s resources were inadequate to such an attack,-91.529
The expense shall not be thought of and though he is so liberal and so fond of Jane that I dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance we could not suffer it to be so you know,-354.77100000000013
And then lowering her voice I suppose Mrs Jennings has heard all about it,-132.40099999999998
Her mind was in a state of flutter and wonder which made it impossible for her to be collected,-163.01600000000002
no there is but one,-40.161
Marianne s ideas were still at intervals fixed incoherently on her mother and whenever she mentioned her name it gave a pang to the heart of poor Elinor who reproaching herself for having trifled with so many days of illness and wretched for some immediate relief fancied that all relief might soon be in vain that every thing had been delayed too long and pictured to herself her suffering mother arriving too late to see this darling child or to see her rational,-773.6239999999993
Will you promise me to mention it when you see them again,-109.40299999999999
That is I presume it to be so on her side and I can answer for its being so on his,-170.035
Had he said any thing to bear a different construction I should not have believed him,-144.79099999999997
When his letter to Mrs Weston arrived Emma had the perusal of it and she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her at first shake her head over her own sensations and think she had undervalued their strength,-370.499
I hope he will be calling soon,-60.666
Songs and proverbs all talk of woman s fickleness,-66.188
How horrid all this is,-50.26400000000001
I left them there and came on to Hartfield impatient for your opinion and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot,-259.59999999999997
She was just in time to see him turn into the Concert Room,-121.68699999999998
People who have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style,-152.203
I can imagine that if you as you are Mr Knightley were to be transported and placed all at once in Mr Frank Churchill s situation you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for him and it might have a very good effect,-408.858
It would place her in the same village with Captain Wentworth within half a mile of him they would have to frequent the same church and there must be intercourse between the two families,-308.37800000000004
There we differ Mary said Anne,-55.727000000000004
A heavy scene however awaited me before I could leave Devonshire I was engaged to dine with you on that very day some apology was therefore necessary for my breaking this engagement,-303.172
Emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about Mr Frank Churchill s not coming except as a disappointment at Randalls,-235.1
CHAPTER XV,-28.290999999999997
Thank you thank you but on no account I would rather walk And for me to be afraid of walking alone I who may so soon have to guard others,-269.42400000000004
She would certainly have risen to their blessings if she could but she did not want to lessen theirs,-167.83
I will not reason here nor will I stop for YOU to expatiate on the absurdity and the worse than absurdity of scrupling to engage my faith where my honour was already bound,-307.89500000000004
She could only offer one solution it was perhaps for Elizabeth s sake,-114.87699999999998
He told me at parting that he should soon write and he spoke in a manner which seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now,-255.98800000000008
A sensible man and he had looked like a very sensible man why should it be an object to him,-174.49599999999998
What would you advise me to do in such a case Miss Dashwood,-113.219
We will not despair however,-51.745999999999995
Long before I was enough recovered to talk I was perfectly able to reflect,-131.942
Time she knew must be allowed for this being thoroughly done and she could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr Elton in particular but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet s age and with the entire extinction of all hope such a progress might be made towards a state of composure by the time of Mr Elton s return as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them,-858.2069999999998
said Miss Bates joyfully my mother is so pleased she says she cannot bear to have the poor old Vicarage without a mistress,-211.173
This had happened the year before,-56.066
Though his eyes had been long opened even before his acquaintance with Elinor began to her ignorance and a want of liberality in some of her opinions they had been equally imputed by him to her want of education and till her last letter reached him he had always believed her to be a well disposed good hearted girl and thoroughly attached to himself,-574.7209999999999
You do not know it I dare say but two or three years ago I had a great passion for taking likenesses and attempted several of my friends and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general,-335.10400000000004
I see how it is said she,-53.614
He cannot bear the idea of not being Sir William,-92.027
She held the parcel towards her and Emma read the words Most precious treasures on the top,-167.425
Mr Perry has been with her as you probably heard,-86.974
That crime has been the origin of every lesser one and of all his present discontents,-145.48800000000003
That was the act of a very very young man one too young to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure,-231.34500000000003
There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as that said Mr Knightley feelingly and for a moment or two he had done,-229.303
I am so ill I can hardly speak,-70.90899999999999
If Mr Elton on his return made his own indifference as evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do she could not imagine Harriet s persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the recollection of him,-373.857
She had set out from Mrs Goddard s half an hour ago she had been afraid it would rain she had been afraid it would pour down every moment but she thought she might get to Hartfield first she had hurried on as fast as possible but then as she was passing by the house where a young woman was making up a gown for her she thought she would just step in and see how it went on and though she did not seem to stay half a moment there soon after she came out it began to rain and she did not know what to do so she ran on directly as fast as she could and took shelter at Ford s,-1085.705
Marianne looked at her steadily and said You know Elinor that this is a kind of talking which I cannot bear,-183.355
said Marianne money can only give happiness where there is nothing else to give it,-139.127
May she always be poor if she can employ her riches no better,-128.35899999999998
You must think one five hundred million times more above me than the other,-132.30399999999997
Why to own the truth I am afraid you are rather thrown away and that with every disposition to bear there will be nothing to be borne,-236.18300000000005
always my kindest friend on every occasion,-72.548
I hope not he replied trying to look cheerful and with a forced smile presently added It is I who may rather expect to be ill for I am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment,-331.71000000000004
Your uncle,-25.43
laughing heartily I would not venture over a horsepond in it,-95.94999999999999
We are sure of excellent fires continued he and every thing in the greatest comfort,-130.321
in a tone of wonder and pity I had no idea that the law had been so great a slavery,-158.908
Such events are very interesting but the suspense of them cannot last long,-127.06
Lady Dalrymple Lady Dalrymple was the rejoicing sound and with all the eagerness compatible with anxious elegance Sir Walter and his two ladies stepped forward to meet her,-284.86800000000005
He had intended on first arriving to proceed very soon into Shropshire and visit the brother settled in that country but the attractions of Uppercross induced him to put this off,-294.29100000000005
The neighbourhood was not large but the Musgroves were visited by everybody and had more dinner parties and more callers more visitors by invitation and by chance than any other family,-286.339
While you were in the smallest degree wavering I said nothing about it because I would not influence but it would have been the loss of a friend to me,-242.92700000000002
A day or two passed without producing anything,-87.509
He was shy and disposed to abstraction but the engaging mildness of her countenance and gentleness of her manners soon had their effect and Anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion,-298.694
That was what I said immediately I was most uncommonly shocked indeed Poor Edward he has done for himself completely shut himself out for ever from all decent society but as I directly said to my mother I am not in the least surprised at it from his style of education it was always to be expected,-510.5120000000002
She then took another line of expediency and looking into the doubtful room observed,-145.355
She remembered what Mr Knightley had once said to her about Mr Elton the caution he had given the conviction he had professed that Mr Elton would never marry indiscreetly and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she had reached herself,-462.45300000000003
When they stopped at the door Mrs Jennings recollected that there was a lady at the other end of the street on whom she ought to call and as she had no business at Gray s it was resolved that while her young friends transacted their s she should pay her visit and return for them,-485.03800000000007
His air his coat his horse,-68.08800000000001
It must be terrible for you to hear it talked of and as for your sister I am sure I would not mention a word about it to her for the world,-254.254
Yes he replied gravely once I have,-67.811
How could she have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued,-136.137
It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy She was extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the Eltons and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much alike and his praise of Harriet his concession in her favour was peculiarly gratifying,-562.3659999999998
But whether she would do for a lady s maid I am sure I can t tell,-151.552
cried Mary in an ecstasy just as I said,-83.972
Very well replied Emma a most natural feeling and the longer it lasts the better I shall be pleased,-163.056
A piece of paper was found on the table this morning dropt we suppose by a fairy containing a very pretty charade and we have just copied it in,-285.92999999999995
Mr Knightley cannot stop,-42.093999999999994
It was a pity perhaps that he had not come last night for though the child seemed well now very well considering it would probably have been better if Perry had seen it,-292.14200000000005
You must see the difference,-44.867
It had not been built many years and was in good repair,-109.21299999999998
Mr Woodhouse had been exceedingly well amused,-68.287
The waiter came into the room soon afterwards,-82.025
Marianne not contented with absolutely refusing to go herself was very urgent to prevent her sister s going at all and Mrs Jennings though her carriage was always at Elinor s service so very much disliked Mrs John Dashwood that not even her curiosity to see how she looked after the late discovery nor her strong desire to affront her by taking Edward s part could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again,-690.6449999999999
Mrs Harville must be an odd mother to part with them so long,-116.153
She was now lying on the faded sofa of the pretty little drawing room the once elegant furniture of which had been gradually growing shabby under the influence of four summers and two children and on Anne s appearing greeted her with,-373.205
I could not have answered it to my conscience to let it fall into any other hands,-150.00300000000001
They were permitted to go alone and with a cordial nod from one and a graceful bow from the other the two gentlemen took leave,-231.165
I had been grossly wrong and must abide the consequences,-79.806
Her countenance perhaps might express some watchfulness but the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought in her sister,-224.65800000000004
By a former marriage Mr Henry Dashwood had one son by his present lady three daughters,-163.64300000000003
You know what you are about,-52.51
I am very glad I did think of her,-68.78500000000001
Willoughby on his side gave every proof of his pleasure in their acquaintance which an evident wish of improving it could offer,-206.83199999999997
She was quite determined not to utter a word that should hurt Jane Fairfax s feelings and they followed the other ladies out of the room arm in arm with an appearance of good will highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each,-400.85400000000004
The first month after their marriage was spent with their friend at the Mansion house from whence they could superintend the progress of the Parsonage and direct every thing as they liked on the spot could chuse papers project shrubberies and invent a sweep,-442.3660000000001
He had seen Mrs Croft too she was at Taunton with the admiral and had been present almost all the time they were talking the matter over,-238.10500000000008
John Dashwood was greatly astonished but his nature was calm not open to provocation and he never wished to offend anybody especially anybody of good fortune,-259.22700000000003
Sir Walter wanted to know whether the Crofts travelled with four horses and whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of Bath as it might suit Miss Elliot and himself to visit in but had little curiosity beyond,-383.96999999999997
Elinor would not speak,-34.313
Indeed,-12.87
I made her take her shawl for the evenings are not warm her large new shawl Mrs Dixon s wedding present So kind of her to think of my mother,-260.674
Is anything the matter with her,-54.644000000000005
It would only be giving trouble and distress,-74.80199999999999
It was too old a story Robert Martin had probably ceased to think of Harriet They took a few turns together along the walk The shade was most refreshing and Emma found it the pleasantest part of the day,-374.143
I am very sure you did me good,-65.142
said Edward willing to say any thing that might introduce another subject,-116.22200000000001
It had originated in misapprehension entirely,-65.981
Emma finding her so determined upon neglecting her music had nothing more to say and after a moment s pause Mrs Elton chose another subject,-236.72599999999994
cried Marianne,-20.069
The unpersuadable point which he did not mention Emma guessed to be good behaviour to his father,-148.228
Lady Russell had not been arrived five minutes the day before when a full account of the whole had burst on her but still it must be talked of she must make enquiries she must regret the imprudence lament the result and Captain Wentworth s name must be mentioned by both,-464.10300000000007
If Jane does not get well soon we will call in Mr Perry,-124.712
Would I,-20.625
They were both in ecstasies,-41.329
You would have thrown yourself out of all good society,-93.203
You were mentioning May,-47.01100000000001
She almost ran out of the room and as soon as the door was closed burst into tears of joy which at first she thought would never cease,-255.725
But it was more probable that he should be come to stay,-99.74199999999999
The next morning brought Mr Frank Churchill again,-81.158
Why does not Perry see her,-57.791000000000004
Nobody talked about it,-41.13099999999999
We both abhor suspense,-42.23
When people come in this manner on purpose to ask us how can one say no,-151.64
Mrs Musgrove interposed,-35.586
But he told you that he loved you,-66.91099999999999
This desponding turn of mind though it could not be communicated to Mrs Dashwood gave additional pain to them all in the parting which shortly took place and left an uncomfortable impression on Elinor s feelings especially which required some trouble and time to subdue,-427.15200000000004
They were combined only of anger against herself mortification and deep concern,-119.406
If their evenings at the park were concluded with cards he cheated himself and all the rest of the party to get her a good hand,-227.20000000000005
Whether he were overhearing too she could not determine,-91.82
She would take place of me then and Henrietta would not dislike that,-113.18699999999998
And who are the Ellisons,-38.955000000000005
So passed the first three weeks,-61.592
And they both long to see you of all things for they have heard at Exeter that you are the most beautiful creatures in the world and I have told them it is all very true and a great deal more,-343.49300000000005
Oh yes,-22.820999999999998
They were all three walking about together for an hour or two first round the shrubberies of Hartfield and afterwards in Highbury,-207.59999999999997
Should I,-21.084
You are quite in the right replied Elinor calmly,-84.983
Do you I have no doubt,-50.824
Tell me that not only your house will remain the same but that I shall ever find you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling and that you will always consider me with the kindness which has made everything belonging to you so dear to me,-400.0730000000001
Somehow or other I never happened to be staying at Barton while he was at Allenham,-141.004
Charles and Mary still talked on in the same style he half serious and half jesting maintaining the scheme for the play and she invariably serious most warmly opposing it and not omitting to make it known that however determined to go to Camden Place herself she should not think herself very well used if they went to the play without her,-558.3300000000003
While he stood as if meaning to go but not going her father began his inquiries,-149.71999999999997
Edward made no answer,-39.858
The deception could not continue after this and an explanation immediately took place by which both gained considerable amusement for the moment without any material loss of happiness to either for Mrs Jennings only exchanged one form of delight for another and still without forfeiting her expectation of the first,-476.7390000000001
That she was to all appearance in the last stage of a consumption was yes in such a situation it was my greatest comfort,-198.09900000000005
He had a great deal to say in return and very entertainingly but Emma s feelings were chiefly with Jane in the argument and on leaving Randalls and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men she felt that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill and really regarding him as she did with friendship she had never been more sensible of Mr Knightley s high superiority of character,-631.64
Sometimes I thought it had been but it never was,-80.59799999999998
I mean that he has done it answered Mr Knightley with smiling but determined decision and been accepted,-167.74000000000004
A little while ago every letter to Isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties dinners at Mr Cole s or balls at the Crown,-237.01899999999998
And yet said Emma beginning hastily and with an arch look but soon stopping it was better however to know the worst at once she hurried on And yet perhaps you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it is,-381.8039999999999
Poor Brandon,-23.808999999999997
CHAPTER 48,-17.958
I know he had horses to day for we arrived together and I laughed at him about it but he said not a word that could betray,-227.57500000000002
He got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor s merits without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it was to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse s character than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor s,-437.42600000000016
Depend upon it Mrs Churchill does every thing that any other fine lady ever did,-145.02499999999998
The next question was,-38.035
My astonishment but it would be impossible to describe what I felt,-108.77999999999999
To live no longer with the decencies even of a private gentleman,-108.197
The Willoughbys left town as soon as they were married and Elinor now hoped as there could be no danger of her seeing either of them to prevail on her sister who had never yet left the house since the blow first fell to go out again by degrees as she had done before,-478.235
No Marianne never,-28.93
She had engaged to go as governess to Mrs Smallridge s children a dear friend of Mrs Elton s a neighbour of Maple Grove and by the bye I wonder how Mrs Elton bears the disappointment,-332.336
How do you do my dear,-52.772999999999996
With a faint blush she presently replied,-78.326
This is breaking a head and giving a plaster truly,-93.713
said Mrs John Knightley It is so long since I have seen her except now and then for a moment accidentally in town,-204.725
Mr Knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity,-89.07700000000001
It exactly answers my idea of a fine country because it unites beauty with utility and I dare say it is a picturesque one too because you admire it I can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories grey moss and brush wood but these are all lost on me,-491.449
I had imagined him I confess a degree or two nearer gentility,-117.79599999999999
Dear Miss Woodhouse how could you so mistake me,-85.735
Yes and Miss Atkinson who dined with him once at the Wallises says he is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with,-220.31300000000005
The very day of Mr Elton s going to London produced a fresh occasion for Emma s services towards her friend,-195.392
Mrs Jennings sat on Elinor s right hand and they had not been long seated before she leant behind her and Willoughby and said to Marianne loud enough for them both to hear I have found you out in spite of all your tricks,-384.84799999999996
But that it was so had not only been declared by Lucy s eyes at the time but was declared over again the next morning more openly for at her particular desire Lady Middleton set her down in Berkeley Street on the chance of seeing Elinor alone to tell her how happy she was,-480.18600000000004
To Lady Russell indeed she was a most dear and highly valued god daughter favourite and friend,-159.276
Her faith was plighted and Mr Elliot s character like the Sultaness Scheherazade s head must live another day,-168.35799999999998
You misled me by the term gentleman,-74.92099999999999
Though I think he had better not have married,-77.371
Before they were beyond her hearing however Louisa spoke again,-104.229
Let me entreat you to run no risks,-75.942
Marianne seemed much struck,-41.034
His manners to THEM though calm were perfectly kind to Mrs Jennings most attentively civil and on Colonel Brandon s coming in soon after himself he eyed him with a curiosity which seemed to say that he only wanted to know him to be rich to be equally civil to HIM,-464.9230000000002
for presently she came forward came quite up to me and asked me how I did and seemed ready to shake hands if I would,-224.563
I do not know but I can hardly suppose that at Admiral Croft s time of life and in his profession he should not have many acquaintance in such a place as this,-275.832
I protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one else,-118.21199999999999
Miss Elliot surrounded by her cousins and the principal object of Colonel Wallis s gallantry was quite contented,-178.392
A crowd in a little room Miss Woodhouse you have the art of giving pictures in a few words,-178.353
But it WAS said I know very well and by more than one for Miss Godby told Miss Sparks that nobody in their senses could expect Mr Ferrars to give up a woman like Miss Morton with thirty thousand pounds to her fortune for Lucy Steele that had nothing at all and I had it from Miss Sparks myself,-513.1800000000003
He must be gone within a few hours though without feeling any real alarm for his aunt to lessen his repugnance,-198.513
But in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife with Oh,-109.048
You want your neighbours opinions,-56.887
Here is some mistake I am sure some dreadful mistake,-103.677
He was brought not from doubt or suspense but from misery to happiness and the change was openly spoken in such a genuine flowing grateful cheerfulness as his friends had never witnessed in him before,-321.402
But Sir John would not be satisfied the carriage should be sent for them and they must come,-154.089
But he was confident that he should soon be rich full of life and ardour he knew that he should soon have a ship and soon be on a station that would lead to everything he wanted,-330.1790000000001
From that evening or at least from the time of Miss Woodhouse s encouraging her to think of him Harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more than he had been used to do and of his having indeed quite a different manner towards her a manner of kindness and sweetness Latterly she had been more and more aware of it,-539.4770000000002
When the Crofts called this morning they called here afterwards did not they,-127.64999999999999
It was now his object to marry,-59.456
When it came to such a pitch as this she was not able to refrain from a start or a heavy sigh or even from walking about the room for a few seconds and the only source whence any thing like consolation or composure could be drawn was in the resolution of her own better conduct and the hope that however inferior in spirit and gaiety might be the following and every future winter of her life to the past it would yet find her more rational more acquainted with herself and leave her less to regret when it were gone,-901.5209999999996
So there I have the whip hand of you,-68.614
He was thinking,-26.493
My dear Miss Fairfax young ladies are very sure to be cared for I hope your good grand mama and aunt are well,-220.843
Chapter 10,-30.476999999999997
But you look grave Marianne do you disapprove your sister s choice,-121.362
We really seem quite the fashion,-62.928
Indeed they are very delightful apples and Mrs Wallis does them full justice only we do not have them baked more than twice and Mr Woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times but Miss Woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it,-435.3030000000001
The very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove My brother Mr Suckling s seat a comparison of Hartfield to Maple Grove,-237.76399999999998
Papa do you not think it an excellent improvement,-88.62899999999999
there was no getting away from one s self,-82.842
I do assure you he replied that I have long thought on this point as you think now,-149.95000000000002
To be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum on every rent day is by no means desirable it takes away one s independence,-271.48900000000003
What say you to Mr Weston and Mr Elton,-72.591
Esteem him,-13.926
I give you notice that as I find your son so I shall judge of him I am no flatterer,-165.07099999999994
Knightley,-9.879
Mrs Jennings enforced the necessity,-53.735
If a man had not a wife he soon wants to be afloat again,-114.733
With the Musgroves there was the happy chat of perfect ease with Captain Harville the kind hearted intercourse of brother and sister with Lady Russell attempts at conversation which a delicious consciousness cut short with Admiral and Mrs Croft everything of peculiar cordiality and fervent interest which the same consciousness sought to conceal and with Captain Wentworth some moments of communications continually occurring and always the hope of more and always the knowledge of his being there,-738.4159999999998
Yes could that be wrong after all that had passed But I cannot talk,-123.26699999999998
She knew that when he now took up the Baronetage it was to drive the heavy bills of his tradespeople and the unwelcome hints of Mr Shepherd his agent from his thoughts,-266.402
Emma knew it to have been very much the case,-78.79599999999999
I have no such scruples and I am sure I could put up with every unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort,-191.43800000000002
Why to own the truth cried Miss Bates who had been trying in vain to be heard the last two minutes if I must speak on this subject there is no denying that Mr Frank Churchill might have I do not mean to say that he did not dream it I am sure I have sometimes the oddest dreams in the world but if I am questioned about it I must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring for Mrs Perry herself mentioned it to my mother and the Coles knew of it as well as ourselves but it was quite a secret known to nobody else and only thought of about three days,-1012.5509999999998
Frank Churchill turned towards her to listen,-69.553
John Dashwood was really far from being sorry to see his sisters again it rather gave them satisfaction and his inquiries after their mother were respectful and attentive,-267.47499999999997
While he was so dull it was no wonder that Harriet should be dull likewise and they were both insufferable,-188.90200000000002
She turned through the same gate but could not see them,-101.647
This however was more than she could believe herself and to be composed at such a moment was not only beyond the reach of Marianne it was beyond her wish,-247.946
If he were every thing else must give way but otherwise his friend Cole had been saying so much about his dining with him had made such a point of it that he had promised him conditionally to come,-337.3970000000001
As soon as they were out of sight the ladies of Captain Wentworth s party began talking of them,-169.67999999999998
dear Mrs Croft cried Mrs Musgrove unable to let her finish her speech there is nothing I so abominate for young people as a long engagement,-238.50499999999997
It was foolish it was wrong to take so active a part in bringing any two people together,-168.339
My dearest child said her mother laughing at this rate you must be in continual terror of MY decay and it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty,-358.464
I feel a strong persuasion this morning that I shall soon be abroad,-119.312
The resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening,-121.04100000000001
Wentworth Captain Wentworth of the navy,-56.775
He spoke of its being out of repair,-76.238
Much as you suffer now think of what you would have suffered if the discovery of his character had been delayed to a later period if your engagement had been carried on for months and months as it might have been before he chose to put an end to it,-446.04500000000013
Elinor flattered herself that some one of their connections in London would write to them to announce the event and give farther particulars but day after day passed off and brought no letter no tidings,-334.64599999999996
Hum said Mrs Ferrars very pretty and without regarding them at all returned them to her daughter,-150.048
His wish of staying longer evidently did not please but it was not opposed,-134.49899999999997
I could wish the stairs were handsome,-62.684
Modest Sir Walter,-28.022000000000002
Their hours were therefore made over to Lady Middleton and the two Miss Steeles by whom their company in fact was as little valued as it was professedly sought,-277.076
My dear said he to his lady it is very provoking that we should be so few,-146.008
I only mean that if Mr Elliot should some time hence pay his addresses to you and if you should be disposed to accept him I think there would be every possibility of your being happy together,-329.734
Pleased to find herself more comfortably situated in that particular than she had expected Elinor was very willing to compound for the want of much real enjoyment from any of their evening parties which whether at home or abroad formed only for cards could have little to amuse her,-443.70900000000006
Engagement,-6.274
It would be a great comfort to Mr Weston as he grew older and even Mr Weston might be growing older ten years hence to have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense the freaks and the fancies of a child never banished from home and Mrs Weston no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her and it would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach should not have their powers in exercise again,-744.5469999999998
she repeated surprised at his being so long in the same county with Elinor without seeing her before,-163.32299999999998
Captain Benwick had been seen flying by their house with a countenance which showed something to be wrong and they had set off immediately informed and directed as they passed towards the spot,-309.65
Well my dear I wish you joy of it again and again and if ever there was a happy couple in the world I think I shall soon know where to look for them,-282.192
Have you forgot the last evening of our being together at Barton,-115.97800000000001
Emma found that she must wait and now it required little effort,-111.21100000000001
said Mr Woodhouse always the last to make his way in conversation then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady,-250.51700000000002
She had never seen Frank Churchill so silent and stupid,-96.87300000000002
Lady Middleton was more agreeable than her mother only in being more silent,-117.54199999999999
Upon the knoll behind the house,-52.07900000000001
And you really are not engaged to him,-66.947
Mr Dixon s preference of her music to her friend s I can answer for being very decided,-157.67599999999993
He omitted no opportunity of being with them threw himself in their way called at all hours but I need not be particular on this subject,-231.75200000000004
I am serious Miss Woodhouse whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy I am sick of England and would leave it to morrow if I could,-235.61699999999996
No you shall send it to Hartfield if you please,-91.43199999999999
She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness,-79.545
He shook his head with a smile and looked as if he had very little doubt and very little mercy,-177.88799999999998
In this calm kind of way with very little interest on either side they continued to talk both of them out of spirits and the thoughts of both engaged elsewhere,-277.3259999999999
And thus ended their discourse,-59.571
One thing DID disturb her and of that she made her daily complaint,-125.32699999999998
You know his hand I dare say a charming one it is but that is not written so well as usual He was tired I dare say for he had just filled the sheet to me as full as possible,-353.2660000000001
said Marianne my dear Edward this must not be,-76.41199999999999
He will think all the happiness all the advantage on your side of the question all the merit on mine,-171.01600000000002
Sir John wanted the whole family to walk to the Park directly and look at his guests,-156.359
No sooner was his father s funeral over than Mrs John Dashwood without sending any notice of her intention to her mother in law arrived with her child and their attendants,-275.812
Chapter 14,-20.144
I remember Fanny used to say that she would marry sooner and better than you did not but what she is exceedingly fond of YOU but so it happened to strike her,-283.925
We are not asked to dine with them however till the day after Mrs Musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey which is not very likely considering the care that will be taken of her and it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to morrow,-456.6800000000001
It was a merry joyous party and no one seemed in higher spirits than Captain Wentworth,-155.806
And when Mrs Bates was saying something to Emma whispered farther We do not say a word of any assistance that Perry might have not a word of a certain young physician from Windsor Oh,-318.378
I do not think she has been in this house three times this summer,-123.919
Jane,-10.238
I thought our judgments were given us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours,-127.588
I should very much like to see Lyme again said Anne,-95.297
The sight of you Edward is the only comfort it has afforded and thank Heaven,-139.541
You find me trying to be useful tell me if you think I shall succeed,-142.166
Mr Elton is a very pretty young man to be sure and a very good young man and I have a great regard for him,-197.53599999999994
Thy ready wit the word will soon supply,-80.364
We really must wish you good night,-68.144
Mr Weston must be between forty and fifty,-77.294
He had made his fortune bought his house and obtained his wife and was beginning a new period of existence with every probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through,-305.0589999999999
Not to my feelings,-36.051
The change was indubitable,-42.354
I could not give any connected detail yesterday but the suddenness and in one light the unseasonableness with which the affair burst out needs explanation for though the event of the 26th ult as you will conclude immediately opened to me the happiest prospects I should not have presumed on such early measures but from the very particular circumstances which left me not an hour to lose,-619.0120000000003
There is something about Frederick more to our taste,-88.36699999999999
He was more engaged with Louisa than with Henrietta,-81.968
I suspect said Sir Walter coolly that Admiral Croft will be best known in Bath as the renter of Kellynch Hall,-199.83800000000002
Altered beyond his knowledge,-37.285
She rather suspected it to be so on the very first evening of their being together from his listening so attentively while she sang to them and when the visit was returned by the Middletons dining at the cottage the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again,-433.0910000000001
Sir Walter Elliot of Kellynch Hall in Somersetshire was a man who for his own amusement never took up any book but the Baronetage there he found occupation for an idle hour and consolation in a distressed one there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents there any unwelcome sensations arising from domestic affairs changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over the almost endless creations of the last century and there if every other leaf were powerless he could read his own history with an interest which never failed,-952.7449999999994
I hope Mrs Bates and Miss Fairfax are,-68.81299999999999
ONE person I was sure would represent me as capable of any thing What I felt was dreadful My resolution was soon made and at eight o clock this morning I was in my carriage,-329.0469999999999
Well if you give me such kind encouragement Mr Elton I believe I shall try what I can do,-173.68099999999998
These convictions must unquestionably have their own pain and severe was its kind but they precluded that pain which Lady Russell would suffer in entering the house again and returning through the well known apartments,-333.7250000000001
He hoped she might make some amends for the many very plain faces he was continually passing in the streets,-197.091
How much could it not tempt her to forgive,-80.161
The struggle was great but it ended too soon,-85.236
Only half an hour before her friend called for her at Mrs Goddard s her evil stars had led her to the very spot where at that moment a trunk directed to The Rev Philip Elton White Hart Bath was to be seen under the operation of being lifted into the butcher s cart which was to convey it to where the coaches past and every thing in this world excepting that trunk and the direction was consequently a blank,-702.3199999999998
Breakfast had not been long over when they were joined by Captain and Mrs Harville and Captain Benwick with whom they had appointed to take their last walk about Lyme,-274.35600000000005
replied Charles what s an evening party,-68.10499999999999
Oh don t be so sly before us said Mrs Palmer for we know all about it I assure you and I admire your taste very much for I think he is extremely handsome,-309.686
I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man,-99.975
She says I fidget her to death and Miss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same,-159.75500000000002
Mr Weston was to call in the evening and she must return it by him,-116.24600000000001
You are trying not to smile,-54.917
So dull so wretchedly dull But I have much to say to you on that head which cannot be said now,-189.52200000000005
He had been so fortunate as to I forget the precise words one has no business to remember them,-161.43299999999996
Do you know Miss Bates s niece,-69.15
I have often thought them the worst of the two replied he coolly,-113.67399999999999
Such an opportunity of being with Edward and his family was above all things the most material to her interest and such an invitation the most gratifying to her feelings,-263.716
How could he contrive to come,-57.24
But she was too ignorant and giddy for respect and he had never loved her,-122.18700000000001
I am a great advocate for timidity and I am sure one does not often meet with it But in those who are at all inferior it is extremely prepossessing,-245.91000000000005
All these jealousies and discontents however were so totally unsuspected by Mrs Jennings that she thought it a delightful thing for the girls to be together and generally congratulated her young friends every night on having escaped the company of a stupid old woman so long,-425.6870000000001
There she sat and who would have guessed how many tears she had been lately shedding,-157.179
But it was too late,-43.288
An airing in the Hartfield carriage would have been the rack and arrowroot from the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison,-169.56100000000004
But I kept my eye on it and as soon as I dared caught it up and never parted with it again from that moment,-215.13100000000003
She would not look again,-42.824
And my dear whenever he comes you had better let him look at little Bella s throat,-169.773
Ay so do Sir John cried Mrs Jennings and then perhaps you may find out what his business is,-179.486
I offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own than when you almost broke it eight years and a half ago,-226.73699999999997
I have really for some time past for at least these three months cared nothing about him,-161.92399999999998
I praised the fair lady too and altogether sent him away very happy,-125.63199999999999
I shall not be far off if you want me,-85.77
Anne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going,-117.88599999999998
You are resolved to think him blameable because he took leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shewn,-208.02300000000002
It was most unlikely therefore that he should ever want his father s assistance,-132.68099999999998
Do you think so,-35.271
It is infinitely too bad,-51.754000000000005
You had somehow or other broken bounds yesterday and run away from your own management but to day you are got back again and as I cannot be always with you it is best to believe your temper under your own command rather than mine,-418.11300000000006
Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she wanted observed Mrs Weston to him not in the least suspecting that she was addressing a lover The expression of the eye is most correct but Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes,-388.641
I hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town,-118.64400000000002
Harriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party,-101.018
Yet she could not bear this silence,-68.01299999999999
happy house could you know what I suffer in now viewing you from this spot from whence perhaps I may view you no more And you ye well known trees but you will continue the same No leaf will decay because we are removed nor any branch become motionless although we can observe you no longer No you will continue the same unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you occasion and insensible of any change in those who walk under your shade But who will remain to enjoy you,-872.7239999999997
I cannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever,-79.41199999999999
No till Cole alluded to my supposed attachment it had never entered my head,-140.016
Truth obliged her to acknowledge some small share in the action but she was at the same time so unwilling to appear as the benefactress of Edward that she acknowledged it with hesitation which probably contributed to fix that suspicion in his mind which had recently entered it,-429.41200000000003
In another moment a happier sight caught her Mr Knightley leading Harriet to the set Never had she been more surprized seldom more delighted than at that instant,-274.14900000000006
Her change was equal This one half hour had given to each the same precious certainty of being beloved had cleared from each the same degree of ignorance jealousy or distrust On his side there had been a long standing jealousy old as the arrival or even the expectation of Frank Churchill He had been in love with Emma and jealous of Frank Churchill from about the same period one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other,-746.6389999999998
At last however and after I had been six months in England I DID find her,-151.118
But while she wondered at the difference of the two young men she did not find that the emptiness of conceit of the one put her out of all charity with the modesty and worth of the other,-317.07
Frank Churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of Miss Fairfax s situation in life,-155.721
You were very bad with the measles that is you would have been very bad but for Perry s great attention,-183.04399999999998
Can not we be gone to morrow,-64.732
One is so fenced and guarded from the weather that not a breath of air can find its way unpermitted,-179.148
He must love somebody,-41.903999999999996
When you have lived to my age you will begin to think letters are never worth going through the rain for,-195.97099999999998
Have you finished it,-40.38099999999999
Anne had not wanted this visit to Uppercross to learn that a removal from one set of people to another though at a distance of only three miles will often include a total change of conversation opinion and idea,-352.09099999999995
There is no comparison between them,-58.986000000000004
I want your interest with him,-52.178000000000004
Let us be discreet quite on our good behaviour Hush You remember those lines I forget the poem at this moment,-204.65499999999997
Certainly Captain Benwick,-36.347
They then talked on for a few minutes longer without her catching a syllable when another lucky stop in Marianne s performance brought her these words in the Colonel s calm voice,-316.581
In Colonel Brandon alone of all her new acquaintance did Elinor find a person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities excite the interest of friendship or give pleasure as a companion,-330.206
She hardly wished to have more leisure for them,-80.25399999999999
And the more sensibility you betray of their just horrors the more I shall like you,-146.432
They were interrupted by the servant s coming in to announce the carriage being at the door and Mrs Jennings immediately preparing to go said,-224.85899999999998
It is not likely that I should now see or hear any thing to change them,-136.052
But that he should talk of encouragement should consider her as aware of his views accepting his attentions meaning in short to marry him should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind look down upon her friend so well understanding the gradations of rank below him and be so blind to what rose above as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her It was most provoking,-652.1679999999999
Sir Walter indeed though he had no affection for Anne and no vanity flattered to make him really happy on the occasion was very far from thinking it a bad match for her,-294.812
Her manners too and Mr Elton s were unpleasant towards Harriet,-104.748
Her affection must have overpowered her judgment,-72.027
said she in a low and disappointed voice as she turned away to the window,-127.97599999999998
She was reminded more than once of having always said she would never marry and assured that it would be a great deal better for her to remain single and told of poor Isabella and poor Miss Taylor But it would not do,-373.65100000000007
But Mr Woodhouse how was Mr Woodhouse to be induced to consent he who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a distant event,-234.48499999999999
Why was it so much worse that Harriet should be in love with Mr Knightley than with Frank Churchill,-164.22800000000004
Not till the first week of August when he came home from the Cape just made into the Grappler,-178.572
I certainly get better and better Now for it,-79.312
He had walked up one day after dinner as he very often did to spend his evening at Hartfield,-173.429
She left it to himself to recollect that Mrs Smith was not the only widow in Bath between thirty and forty with little to live on and no surname of dignity,-266.3189999999999
After that I suppose I WAS wrong in remaining so much in Sussex and the arguments with which I reconciled myself to the expediency of it were no better than these The danger is my own I am doing no injury to anybody but myself,-415.95700000000005
Within a fortnight,-35.135000000000005
no I would get you a better partner than myself,-89.97800000000001
This is full proof undoubtedly proof of every thing you were saying,-119.62
Smith had somehow or other been informed I imagine by some distant relation whose interest it was to deprive me of her favour of an affair a connection but I need not explain myself farther he added looking at her with an heightened colour and an enquiring eye your particular intimacy you have probably heard the whole story long ago,-593.5270000000003
You need not be afraid Miss Elliot of your own sweet flower gardens being neglected,-156.956
Anne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness and quite as much so for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying,-199.735
A woman of seven and twenty said Marianne after pausing a moment can never hope to feel or inspire affection again and if her home be uncomfortable or her fortune small I can suppose that she might bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse for the sake of the provision and security of a wife,-529.5690000000002
I assure you Miss Woodhouse it is very delightful to me to be reminded of a place I am so extremely partial to as Maple Grove,-227.71900000000002
She supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his clemency but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself in his opinion,-248.537
Miss Woodhouse,-18.934
Emma in the meanwhile could not be satisfied without a dinner at Hartfield for the Eltons,-140.043
He had not time to enter into much explanation,-81.687
But I only mean to say that there are advertising offices and that by applying to them I should have no doubt of very soon meeting with something that would do,-259.519
Her making a fourth when they sat down to dinner was noticed as an advantage,-141.49800000000005
But in return your sister must allow me to feel no more than I profess,-137.185
Quite the contrary replied Elinor looking expressively at Marianne,-98.206
My dear Mrs,-28.914
Mrs Dashwood feared to hazard any remark and ventured not to offer consolation,-133.08599999999998
cried Marianne her eyes sparkling with animation and her cheeks glowing with the delight of such imaginary happiness,-182.03199999999998
That has been a very great improvement,-65.179
He was immediately interested,-39.579
Jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold,-102.36099999999999
Our respected father as you well know bequeathed all the Stanhill effects that remained at Norland and very valuable they were to your mother,-227.76699999999997
He stays till to morrow and Miss Fairfax has been persuaded to spend the day with us They are coming in I hope,-200.312
She had seen the same Frederick Wentworth,-66.185
How will a conundrum reckon,-58.427
I shall never forget his flying Henry s kite for him that very windy day last Easter and ever since his particular kindness last September twelvemonth in writing that note at twelve o clock at night on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham I have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence If any body can deserve him it must be Miss Taylor,-724.122
I have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn every blessing that I enjoyed,-159.32800000000003
You surprise me I should think it must nearly have escaped her memory by THIS time,-156.571
Once I felt the fire rather too much but then I moved back my chair a little a very little and it did not disturb me,-236.95899999999997
It was not the first time of her feeling the same kind of conviction for more than once before beginning with the observation of your sister looks unwell to day or your sister seems out of spirits he had appeared on the point either of disclosing or of inquiring something particular about her,-465.21600000000007
The substance of this letter was forwarded to Emma in a note from Mrs Weston instantly,-138.575
Oh dear,-20.305
Not that you have any reason to regret my dear Elinor,-97.851
For two or three months longer I shall remain where I am and as I am,-146.814
Elinor saw with great uneasiness the low spirits of her friend,-100.286
At her time of life any thing of an illness destroys the bloom for ever,-130.99099999999999
You are very right in supposing how my money would be spent some of it at least my loose cash would certainly be employed in improving my collection of music and books,-295.5
But Mr Elton in person had driven away all such cares,-106.78700000000002
Then remembering Colonel Brandon reproved herself felt that to HIS sufferings and his constancy far more than to his rival s the reward of her sister was due and wished any thing rather than Mrs Willoughby s death,-350.987
This is a pleasure said he in rather a low voice coming at least ten minutes earlier than I had calculated,-200.485
What a thinking brain you have,-58.046
Mrs Smith had been carried away from her first direction and Anne had forgotten in the interest of her own family concerns how much had been originally implied against him but her attention was now called to the explanation of those first hints and she listened to a recital which if it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of Mrs Smith proved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her very deficient both in justice and compassion,-729.8319999999999
She is playing Robin Adair at this moment his favourite,-88.98400000000001
But neither Charles Hayter s feelings nor anybody s feelings could interest her till she had a little better arranged her own,-208.292
Elinor confirmed in every pleasant hope was all cheerfulness rejoicing that in her letters to her mother she had pursued her own judgment rather than her friend s in making very light of the indisposition which delayed them at Cleveland and almost fixing on the time when Marianne would be able to travel,-492.28700000000003
I hope his letter does not breathe the spirit of an ill used man,-130.94799999999998
Shall we walk Augusta,-52.811
I should have been sorry Mr Knightley to be dependent on your recommendation had I quitted Mr Woodhouse s family and wanted another situation I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any body,-346.374
Instead of talking of Edward they came gradually to talk only of Robert a subject on which he had always more to say than on any other and in which she soon betrayed an interest even equal to his own and in short it became speedily evident to both that he had entirely supplanted his brother,-501.9400000000001
Mrs Dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth it was ready furnished and she might have immediate possession,-167.453
I had no reason to believe her of less authority now,-93.177
He stopped,-22.221
One question after this only remained undecided between them one difficulty only was to be overcome,-161.116
Yes yes but I am amused that he should have seen so far into my feelings,-147.379
He has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all You must let me read it to him,-169.54999999999998
I was at Norland about a month ago,-74.039
