 Isabella does not seem more my sister has never excited a greater interest perhaps hardly so great,-221.78599999999997
 My peace of mind is doubly involved in it for not only is it horrible to suspect a person who has been what HE has been to ME of such designs but what must it make me appear to myself What in a situation like mine but a most shamefully unguarded affection could expose me to,-702.2820000000002
 She wished very much to have the subject continued though she did not chuse to join in it herself but nothing more of it was said and for the first time in her life she thought Mrs Jennings deficient either in curiosity after petty information or in a disposition to communicate it,-611.9470000000001
 John Knightley looked at him with amazement then shrugged his shoulders and said I could not have believed it even of him,-258.60999999999996

 One observation may I think be fairly drawn from the whole of the story that all Willoughby s difficulties have arisen from the first offence against virtue in his behaviour to Eliza Williams,-403.8420000000001
 Anne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing but the age of emotion she certainly had not,-228.214

 She had great pleasure in hearing Frank Churchill talked of and for his sake greater pleasure than ever in seeing Mr and Mrs Weston she was very often thinking of him and quite impatient for a letter that she might know how he was how were his spirits how was his aunt and what was the chance of his coming to Randalls again this spring,-764.6150000000001

 I have not a fault to find with her person he replied,-132.466
 Very odd indeed,-42.679
 The circumstance was told him at Hartfield for the moment he was silent but Emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself over a newspaper he held in his hand Hum,-397.7660000000001
 His aunt was so much better that he had not a doubt of getting over to them Mrs,-209.629
 Captain Weston who had been considered especially by the Churchills as making such an amazing match was proved to have much the worst of the bargain for when his wife died after a three years marriage he was rather a poorer man than at first and with a child to maintain,-625.746
 Consider here are the two Miss Careys come over from Newton the three Miss Dashwoods walked up from the cottage and Mr Willoughby got up two hours before his usual time on purpose to go to Whitwell,-461.77500000000015

 A year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived at West Hall and how they got their fortune nobody knows,-314.35800000000006
 Two steps Jane take care of the two steps,-113.922
 And without farther ceremony she turned away and walked to the instrument,-147.702
 Miss Woodhouse what do you think has happened,-93.265
 She understood their ways could allow for their ignorance and their temptations had no romantic expectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had done so little entered into their troubles with ready sympathy and always gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good will,-587.8620000000002
 I heard it from the servant,-71.429
 Pray pray let me hear it,-76.43799999999999
 Her apprehensions once raised paid by their excess for all her former security and the servant who sat up with her for she would not allow Mrs Jennings to be called only tortured her more by hints of what her mistress had always thought,-534.69
 It is a sort of thing cried Mrs Elton emphatically which I should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into,-227.90899999999996

 I am sure I must have been as white as my gown,-121.28900000000003
 She is very fond of Frank and therefore I would not speak ill of her,-167.901
 However I got a very good husband and I don t know what the greatest beauty can do more,-238.12499999999997
 Emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault,-132.029
 Two delighful twilight walks on the third and fourth evenings of her being there not merely on the dry gravel of the shrubbery but all over the grounds and especially in the most distant parts of them where there was something more of wildness than in the rest where the trees were the oldest and the grass was the longest and wettest had assisted by the still greater imprudence of sitting in her wet shoes and stockings given Marianne a cold so violent as though for a day or two trifled with or denied would force itself by increasing ailments on the concern of every body and the notice of herself,-1352.3340000000003
 I have always been blessed with excellent health and no climate disagrees with me,-161.108
 He may spend the evening with his dear William Larkins now if he likes,-172.007
 Indeed you did,-41.092
 His manners were an immediate recommendation and on conversing with him she found the solid so fully supporting the superficial that she was at first as she told Anne almost ready to exclaim Can this be Mr Elliot,-456.6920000000001
 Oh,-10.600000000000001
 I went only to the post office said she and reached home before the rain was much,-205.54799999999997
 Rather say your mother s imprudence my child said Mrs Dashwood SHE must be answerable,-186.01200000000003
 Making up indeed would not do,-73.646
 It may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to be understood,-182.082
 do come in,-46.617000000000004
 Dear me how clever Could it really be meant for me,-139.82200000000003
 Emma allowed her father to talk but supplied her visitors in a much more satisfactory style and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy,-362.8530000000001
 Exert yourself dear Marianne she cried if you would not kill yourself and all who love you,-209.67899999999997
 for of course you must know as you have been in Devonshire so lately,-167.75199999999998
 Law my dear,-34.187
 Mrs Dashwood s visit to Lady Middleton took place the next day and two of her daughters went with her but Marianne excused herself from being of the party under some trifling pretext of employment and her mother who concluded that a promise had been made by Willoughby the night before of calling on her while they were absent was perfectly satisfied with her remaining at home,-803.5120000000003
 cried Emma not attending to her Mrs,-90.563
 My charge would be much more concise than her s and probably not much in the same spirit all that I have to recommend being comprised in do not spoil them and do not physic them,-430.2680000000001
 We think so very differently on this point Mr Knightley that there can be no use in canvassing it,-227.96199999999996
 All this ran so glibly through her thoughts that by the time her father had arranged himself after the bustle of the Eltons departure and was ready to speak she was very tolerably capable of attending,-443.271
 At last the affair was decided,-77.172
 She opened the packet it was too surely so a note from Mrs Weston to herself ushered in the letter from Frank to Mrs Weston,-296.221
 Chapter 22,-31.641
 My regard for her for yourself for your mother will you allow me to prove it by relating some circumstances which nothing but a VERY sincere regard nothing but an earnest desire of being useful I think I am justified though where so many hours have been spent in convincing myself that I am right is there not some reason to fear I may be wrong,-803.1470000000004
 If we set the example many will follow it as far as they can though all have not our situations,-247.91199999999998
 The intermediate month was the one fixed on as far as they dared by Emma and Mr,-203.45499999999998
 Oh yes papa,-39.908
 When he came back alas,-63.045
 She is not a sensible girl nor a girl of any information,-139.84900000000002
 And then fly off through half a sentence to her mother s old petticoat,-167.918
 That would have been too dreadful What an escape Dear Miss Woodhouse I would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world,-354.37
 Margaret s sagacity was not always displayed in a way so satisfactory to her sister,-186.111
 I might not like them the better for that perhaps,-124.03
 Personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions,-131.21800000000002
 This is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating,-163.815
 I do not advise you to give way to it Harriet,-117.035
 Upon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in they kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired it would save her a full mile and they were going through Uppercross,-476.43700000000007
 Lady Russell felt obliged to oppose her dear Anne s known wishes,-152.676
 She did not attribute guile to any,-83.126
 However it was an exceeding good pretty letter and gave Mr and Mrs Weston a great deal of pleasure,-217.282
 On this point we have been wretched,-93.48
 How was she to bear the change It was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them but Emma was aware that great must be the difference between a Mrs Weston only half a mile from them and a Miss Taylor in the house and with all her advantages natural and domestic she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude,-803.8730000000002
 Come come this won t do Colonel so let us hear the truth of it,-180.26000000000002
 I know very well that Colonel Brandon is not old enough to make his friends yet apprehensive of losing him in the course of nature,-284.914
 Ah,-14.305
 who can think of Miss Smith when Miss Woodhouse is near,-143.741
 He has a wife and family to maintain and is not to be giving away his time,-194.59
 This proves that he can leave the Churchills,-100.33600000000001
 Elinor read and returned it without any comment,-103.40100000000001
 It is a pity they are not knocked on the head at once before they reach Admiral Baldwin s age,-238.15699999999998
 After winding along it for more than a mile they reached their own house,-176.27200000000002
 She could only give him a look but it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses and then left the sofa removing to a seat by her sister and giving her all her attention,-467.43999999999994
 We cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before,-230.836
 But you are too good for that I am sure,-105.29299999999998
 It was in one of these short meetings each apparently occupied in admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants that she said,-265.38
 That is the woman I want said he,-96.914
 They talked a great deal about him especially Anne Cox,-119.12600000000002
 Nay dear Emma now I must take his part for though he has been wrong in this instance I have known him long enough to answer for his having many very many good qualities and,-432.249
 Henry is the eldest he was named after me not after his father,-170.235
 You may imagine how desirable,-63.532000000000004
 But this I can say that if he ever was a beau before he married he is one still for there is not the smallest alteration in him,-329.24600000000004
 That was a great deal too smart for me,-99.57600000000001
 Why was not she to be as useful as Anne,-125.828
 In the mean while she was in the carriage,-95.37100000000001
 He stood as opposed to Captain Wentworth in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness and the evil of his attentions last night the irremediable mischief he might have done was considered with sensations unqualified unperplexed,-404.8070000000001
 Strangers filling their place,-55.299
 CHAPTER X,-22.075000000000003
 What is the matter,-43.757
 She went on herself to give that portion of time to an old servant who was married and settled in Donwell,-262.942
 Elton,-18.051000000000002
 The brow of the hill where they remained was a cheerful spot Louisa returned and Mary finding a comfortable seat for herself on the step of a stile was very well satisfied so long as the others all stood about her but when Louisa drew Captain Wentworth away to try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge row and they were gone by degrees quite out of sight and sound Mary was happy no longer she quarrelled with her own seat was sure Louisa had got a much better somewhere and nothing could prevent her from going to look for a better also,-1275.4289999999999
 Had Mrs Dashwood like her daughter heard Willoughby s story from himself had she witnessed his distress and been under the influence of his countenance and his manner it is probable that her compassion would have been greater,-471.45500000000004
 A widow Mrs Smith lodging in Westgate Buildings,-99.892
 She will not even listen to your questions,-99.60300000000001
 It is an engagement in some respects not prosperously begun for their marriage must be at a very uncertain distance and even secrecy as far as it can be observed may now be very advisable,-428.29600000000005
 She acknowledged therefore that though she had never been informed by themselves of the terms on which they stood with each other of their mutual affection she had no doubt and of their correspondence she was not astonished to hear,-464.02900000000005
 A butcher hard by in the village and the parsonage house within a stone s throw,-206.37699999999995
 Mrs Smith,-24.193
 But the resolution was made only to be broken,-110.53299999999999
 Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons to please she will now have but one,-213.03099999999998
 My doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of the understanding,-142.503
 Harriet really wished and had wished some time to consult a dentist,-154.62199999999999
 Marianne though without knowing it herself reaped all its advantage for neither Mrs Jennings nor Sir John nor even Mrs Palmer herself ever spoke of him before her,-355.1529999999999
 But he is not the only gentleman you have been lately used to,-150.323
 He would gain cheerfulness and she would learn to be an enthusiast for Scott and Lord Byron nay that was probably learnt already of course they had fallen in love over poetry,-392.035
 At present I know him so well that I think him really handsome or at least almost so,-214.19199999999998
,-7.161
 He had probably never heard and never thought of any claims of Charles Hayter,-168.021
 She liked him however upon the whole much better than she had expected and in her heart was not sorry that she could like him no more not sorry to be driven by the observation of his Epicurism his selfishness and his conceit to rest with complacency on the remembrance of Edward s generous temper simple taste and diffident feelings,-711.4880000000003
 Chapter 18,-31.641
 And how beautiful we thought he looked,-89.48800000000001
 She was a clever young woman who understood the art of pleasing the art of pleasing at least at Kellynch Hall and who had made herself so acceptable to Miss Elliot as to have been already staying there more than once in spite of all that Lady Russell who thought it a friendship quite out of place could hint of caution and reserve,-737.0380000000001
 Well my dear he deliberately began considering we never saw her before she seems a very pretty sort of young lady and I dare say she was very much pleased with you,-361.6389999999999
 They remained but a few minutes together as Miss Woodhouse must not be kept waiting and Harriet then came running to her with a smiling face and in a flutter of spirits which Miss Woodhouse hoped very soon to compose,-477.764
 came crying to me the day after in a great fright for fear of Mrs Ferrars as well as not knowing how to get to Plymouth for Lucy it seems borrowed all her money before she went off to be married on purpose we suppose to make a show with and poor Nancy had not seven shillings in the world so I was very glad to give her five guineas to take her down to Exeter where she thinks of staying three or four weeks with Mrs Burgess in hopes as I tell her to fall in with the Doctor again,-1217.4950000000003
 The smallness of the house said she I cannot imagine any inconvenience to them for it will be in proportion to their family and income,-295.125
 If Jane repressed her for a little time she soon began again and though much that passed between them was in a half whisper especially on Mrs Elton s side there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects The post office catching cold fetching letters and friendship were long under discussion and to them succeeded one which must be at least equally unpleasant to Jane inquiries whether she had yet heard of any situation likely to suit her and professions of Mrs Elton s meditated activity,-1060.5120000000006
 Once Lucy thought to write to him but then her spirits rose against that,-182.35299999999995
 The late owner of this estate was a single man who lived to a very advanced age and who for many years of his life had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister,-412.807
 I shall be very glad to look it over said he but it seems long,-166.44
 Just the kind of girl I should suppose likely to captivate poor Edward,-169.06799999999998
 The next remove was to the house they must all go in and eat and they were all seated and busy and still Frank Churchill did not come,-331.64599999999996
 Woodhouse I am so glad Quite out of my power Such a happy little circle as you find us here Yes indeed Charming young man that is so very friendly I mean good Mr,-422.664
 continued Harriet these two last But how shall I ever be able to return the paper or say I have found it out Oh,-298.24199999999996
 They gaily ascended the downs rejoicing in their own penetration at every glimpse of blue sky and when they caught in their faces the animating gales of a high south westerly wind they pitied the fears which had prevented their mother and Elinor from sharing such delightful sensations,-602.5620000000002
 No ma am he did not mention no particular family but he said his master was a very rich gentleman and would be a baronight some day,-316.05199999999996
 They reached town by three o clock the third day glad to be released after such a journey from the confinement of a carriage and ready to enjoy all the luxury of a good fire,-427.81700000000006
 Emma,-17.846
 Marianne s abilities were in many respects quite equal to Elinor s,-149.59700000000004
 A man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her,-181.277
 I do not know who would ever look at him in the company of the other,-166.75699999999998
 When you leave Barton to form your own establishment in a more lasting home Queen Mab shall receive you,-240.97199999999995
 Why really dear Emma I say that he is so very much occupied by the idea of not being in love with her that I should not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last,-432.85200000000003
 I have shewn you Mr Elliot as he was a dozen years ago and I will shew him as he is now,-250.57399999999998
 So altered that he should not have known her again,-117.50600000000001
 There is no quarrelling with you,-68.33
 She wanted her to be more known,-79.14200000000001
 I think we must get him to Bath,-89.61900000000001
 I love him already,-49.068999999999996
 You talk of being proud I am called proud I know and I shall not wish to believe myself otherwise for our pride if investigated would have the same object I have no doubt though the kind may seem a little different,-505.9250000000002
 They are both so very large and take up so much room and Mr Musgrove always sits forward,-222.95599999999996
 Lady Middleton frequently called him to order wondered how any one s attention could be diverted from music for a moment and asked Marianne to sing a particular song which Marianne had just finished,-422.152
 She wanted to hear many particulars of their engagement repeated again she wanted more clearly to understand what Lucy really felt for Edward whether there were any sincerity in her declaration of tender regard for him and she particularly wanted to convince Lucy by her readiness to enter on the matter again and her calmness in conversing on it that she was no otherwise interested in it than as a friend which she very much feared her involuntary agitation in their morning discourse must have left at least doubtful,-1089.1270000000004
 I have another person s interest at present so much at heart that I cannot think any longer about Frank Churchill,-248.044
 Of the lady individually Emma thought very little,-107.651
 He will be here in a moment I am sure,-105.35799999999999
 To Elinor the observation of the latter was particularly grateful,-125.81300000000002
 Poor comfort,-32.542
 Harriet Smith s intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing,-140.924
 I have always heard him spoken of as such and your brother I know esteems him highly,-203.60399999999998
 It must be Willoughby therefore whom you suspect,-98.31500000000001
 Me,-20.137999999999998
 So unlike what a man should be None of that upright integrity that strict adherence to truth and principle that disdain of trick and littleness which a man should display in every transaction of his life,-443.9130000000001
 Nay Mamma if he is not to be animated by Cowper but we must allow for difference of taste,-231.11799999999997
 She had learnt in the last ten minutes more of his feelings towards Louisa more of all his feelings than she dared to think of and she gave herself up to the demands of the party to the needful civilities of the moment with exquisite though agitated sensations,-562.457
 But every thing was then just settled between Miss Grey and me,-149.76700000000002
 This was an opportunity which Anne could not resist she said therefore I hope Admiral I hope there is nothing in the style of Captain Wentworth s letter to make you and Mrs Croft particularly uneasy,-414.4280000000001
 To be sure the charade with its ready wit but then the soft eyes in fact it suited neither it was a jumble without taste or truth,-330.168
 Yes,-15.485000000000001
 This made a difficulty,-52.870000000000005
 I saw her answer nothing could be clearer,-92.75300000000001
 This was all very promising and but for such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut there was nothing to denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him the honour if not of being really in love with her of being at least very near it and saved only by her own indifference for still her resolution held of never marrying the honour in short of being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance,-995.1630000000005
 On the contrary I think a young man might be very safely recommended to take Mr Elton as a model,-241.95499999999996
 But alas,-29.101
 I have a great deal of vivacity in my own way but I really must be allowed to judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue,-305.761
 The morning was chiefly spent in leaving cards at the houses of Mrs Jennings s acquaintance to inform them of her being in town and Marianne was all the time busy in observing the direction of the wind watching the variations of the sky and imagining an alteration in the air,-610.5690000000002
 Indeed that must be a very great pleasure,-93.61700000000002
 A very decent shot and there is not a bolder rider in England,-145.181
 And Mr Weston at the same time walking briskly with long steps through the passage was calling out,-218.21599999999998
 She dared not look up but her mother and Marianne both turned their eyes on him,-195.30299999999997
 There is no hurry at all,-64.098
 It has been it is a most cruel affliction,-104.301
 You are so noble in your ideas,-85.29700000000001
 You will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty and of what she has a claim to that in a little while nobody within her reach will be good enough for her,-406.8600000000001
 The evening is closing in and grandmama will be looking for us,-149.45400000000004
 Miss Woodhouse said Frank Churchill after examining a table behind him which he could reach as he sat have your nephews taken away their alphabets their box of letters,-360.12200000000007
 I do not see it,-47.085
 Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me,-114.65800000000002
 yes,-21.061999999999998
 those letters are convenient passports,-73.919
 Emma s sense of right however had decided it and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother she had particular pleasure from the circumstance of the late disagreement between Mr Knightley and herself in procuring him the proper invitation,-508.4310000000001
 Do you know it Cramer And here are a new set of Irish melodies,-171.231
 She remained in her seat and so did Lady Russell but she had the pleasure of getting rid of Mr Elliot and she did not mean whatever she might feel on Lady Russell s account to shrink from conversation with Captain Wentworth if he gave her the opportunity,-565.2500000000001
 It would amuse away the difficulties of her part and lessen the irksomeness of Miss Smith s,-196.049
 But I did not love only him and while the comfort of others was dear to me I was glad to spare them from knowing how much I felt,-338.6170000000001
 They had an early account from Lyme the next morning,-120.69500000000002
 It is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings with half a heart,-197.67100000000002
 What a great traveller you must have been ma am,-114.149
 My sister will be equally sorry to miss the pleasure of seeing you but she has been very much plagued lately with nervous head aches which make her unfit for company or conversation,-402.2440000000002
 Anxious to omit no possible precaution Anne struggled and said,-122.58500000000001
 She could not refuse to give him hers s he pressed it with affection,-164.121
 It was not Lucy s business to put herself forward and the appearance of secrecy must still be kept up,-238.271
 Had I known as much half an hour ago But since I AM here speaking with a forced vivacity as he returned to his seat what does it signify For once Miss Dashwood it will be the last time perhaps let us be cheerful together I am in a fine mood for gaiety Tell me honestly a deeper glow overspreading his cheeks do you think me most a knave or a fool,-871.2380000000005
 We may well say that our lot is cast in a goodly heritage,-158.50400000000005
 Indeed from Yorkshire I think,-68.164
 can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from Harriet to me Absurd and insufferable,-267.782
 He comes to Highbury himself he says six days out of the seven and has always business at Ford s,-246.167
 And I am not only not going to be married at present but have very little intention of ever marrying at all,-249.04199999999997
 At last with some hesitation Harriet said,-90.82800000000002
 I am sorry to say that my patronage ends with this and my interest is hardly more extensive,-209.22799999999995
 He knows there must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her at the same time,-208.52500000000003
 The picture which she had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter had proved erroneous no friends had deserted them no pleasures had been lost But her present forebodings she feared would experience no similar contradiction,-473.75500000000017
 Elinor was again obliged to decline her invitation and by changing the subject put a stop to her entreaties,-240.63899999999995
 He stopt again rose again and seemed quite embarrassed He was more in love with her than Emma had supposed and who can say how it might have ended if his father had not made his appearance,-440.479
 He will be there in February otherwise London would have no charms for me I have not spirits for it,-233.492
 They all walked about together to see that every thing was as it should be and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of another carriage which Emma could not hear the sound of at first without great surprize,-477.244
 I lay no embargo on any body s words,-112.372
 To satisfy me those characters must be united,-107.29700000000001
 Such a number of looking glasses,-77.114
 Jane Fairfax was an orphan the only child of Mrs Bates s youngest daughter,-173.605
 Mrs Jennings who had watched them with pleasure while they were talking and who expected to see the effect of Miss Dashwood s communication in such an instantaneous gaiety on Colonel Brandon s side as might have become a man in the bloom of youth of hope and happiness saw him with amazement remain the whole evening more serious and thoughtful than usual,-757.6670000000001
 He did not omit being sometimes directly before Miss Smith or speaking to those who were close to her Emma saw it,-265.94599999999997
 Her brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance and their visit in general,-197.696
 Her wretchedness I could have borne but her passion her malice At all events it must be appeased,-223.72099999999998
 Mrs Jennings in the meantime talked on as loud as she could and continued her account of their surprise the evening before on seeing their friends without ceasing till every thing was told,-395.8470000000001
 And so just as he was going away again it came into my head I am sure I do not know how I happened to think of it but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news,-464.3299999999999
 Again they were both silent,-69.793
 He is highly esteemed by all the family at the park and I never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him,-283.435
 So afraid you might have a headache seeing you pass by so often and knowing how much trouble you must have,-261.5609999999999
 Do not you agree with me that it is the best thing he could do both for himself and Mrs Shirley,-244.54599999999996
 Anne replied and spoke in defence of the performance so well and yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly that his countenance improved and he replied again with almost a smile,-401.94800000000004
 This sensation of listlessness weariness stupidity this disinclination to sit down and employ myself this feeling of every thing s being dull and insipid about the house I must be in love I should be the oddest creature in the world if I were not for a few weeks at least,-596.438
 I could not think about you so much without doating on you faults and all and by dint of fancying so many errors have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least,-422.37600000000003
 This would soon have led to something better of course was her consoling reflection any thing interests between those who love and any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart,-425.28000000000003
 My card was not lost I hope,-91.944
 Knightley is quite the gentleman,-66.414
 How few people know what comfort is,-94.391
 Would you in short have renewed the engagement then,-123.38000000000001
 Yes papa it is written out in our second page,-130.43500000000003
 Cold hearted Elinor,-42.646
 She expected from other people the same opinions and feelings as her own and she judged of their motives by the immediate effect of their actions on herself,-351.4460000000001
 I must learn to brook being happier than I deserve,-117.822
 However she is very agreeable and Mrs Bates too in a different way,-165.45199999999997
 If I can come again we are still to have our ball,-152.583
 You like it my Emma as little as I feared I wish our opinions were the same,-211.48399999999998
 Tell me not that I am too late that such precious feelings are gone for ever,-194.61900000000003
 Oh dear yes I know him extremely well replied Mrs Palmer Not that I ever spoke to him indeed but I have seen him for ever in town,-334.606
 It made her animated open hearted she voluntarily said,-116.50500000000001
 Nature gave you understanding Miss Taylor gave you principles,-118.57100000000001
 They are very pretty ma am an t they,-110.69300000000001
 Well what do you say to it I always told you he would be here again soon did not I Anne my dear did not I always tell you so and you would not believe me In town next week you see at the latest I dare say for she is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done most likely they will be there to morrow or Saturday,-885.3120000000004
 said she quickly looking up in his face,-100.553
 How d ye do how d ye do We have been sitting with your father glad to see him so well,-244.31699999999998
 You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs and Miss Bates said Emma I have not heard one inquiry after them,-240.01000000000002
 Four bed rooms and two garrets formed the rest of the house,-142.67600000000002
 He must love her,-48.588
 That is very likely,-48.471999999999994
 She is as low as possible,-69.824
 He listened in perfect silence,-65.697
 It was as much however as was desired and more than was expected by Edward and Elinor and Mrs Ferrars herself by her shuffling excuses seemed the only person surprised at her not giving more,-420.3470000000001
 They will read together,-50.5
 Emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary indeed and that she had not a syllable to say for him,-245.85999999999999
 Lady Russell said not another word willing to leave the matter to its own operation and believing that could Mr Elliot at that moment with propriety have spoken for himself she believed in short what Anne did not believe,-478.0820000000001
 How could you be so insolent in your wit to a woman of her character age and situation Emma I had not thought it possible,-294.517
 Perhaps however he is kept silent by his fear of offending and I shall therefore give him a hint by a line to Oxford that his sister and I both think a letter of proper submission from him addressed perhaps to Fanny and by her shewn to her mother might not be taken amiss for we all know the tenderness of Mrs Ferrars s heart and that she wishes for nothing so much as to be on good terms with her children,-984.5470000000003
 No considering our situation it was not strange,-100.886
 And Frank Churchill was heard to say I think you could manage this without effort the first part is so very trifling,-270.55799999999994
 And now we shall just miss them too provoking I do not know when I have been so disappointed,-210.58700000000005
 She had no longer any inclination to talk to him,-107.083
 Again I demand an explanation of it,-92.001
 He did not speak he did not behave like himself,-112.784
 And at last as if resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person,-397.49899999999997
 Edward who had till then looked any where rather than at her saw her hurry away and perhaps saw or even heard her emotion for immediately afterwards he fell into a reverie which no remarks no inquiries no affectionate address of Mrs Dashwood could penetrate and at last without saying a word quitted the room and walked out towards the village leaving the others in the greatest astonishment and perplexity on a change in his situation so wonderful and so sudden a perplexity which they had no means of lessening but by their own conjectures,-1167.0380000000005
 Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed without reproaches or apparent sense of ill usage and yet Emma fancied there was a something of resentment a something bordering on it in her style which increased the desirableness of their being separate It might be only her own consciousness but it seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke,-809.2210000000001
 She had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself,-163.89000000000001
 For shame Willoughby can you wait for an invitation here,-130.06300000000002
 On the contrary it was a relief to her to be spared the communication of what would give such affliction to them and to be saved likewise from hearing that condemnation of Edward which would probably flow from the excess of their partial affection for herself and which was more than she felt equal to support,-657.6760000000003
 We are never safe from HIM,-78.052
 There were Mr and Mrs Weston delighted to see her and receive her approbation very busy and very happy in their different way she in some little distress and he finding every thing perfect,-407.5050000000001
 One set might recommend their all removing to Donwell and leaving Hartfield for the John Knightleys and another might predict disagreements among their servants but yet upon the whole there was no serious objection raised except in one habitation the Vicarage There the surprize was not softened by any satisfaction,-625.4580000000002
 much thicker than Miss Anne s and in short her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left to walk with Mr Elliot as Anne could be and it was discussed between them with a generosity so polite and so determined that the others were obliged to settle it for them Miss Elliot maintaining that Mrs Clay had a little cold already and Mr Elliot deciding on appeal that his cousin Anne s boots were rather the thickest,-954.4520000000001
 I should not have used the expression,-76.238
 Knightley Neither would she regret that he should be going to Brunswick Square for she knew how much his visit would be enjoyed but it might have happened at a better time and to have had longer notice of it would have been pleasanter They parted thorough friends however she could not be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance and his unfinished gallantry it was all done to assure her that she had fully recovered his good opinion He had been sitting with them half an hour she found,-1060.6030000000003
 Harriet s was,-42.103
 It did not appear to me that in short you know Dr Shirley must have a curate and you had secured his promise,-270.777
 That is what you have in your head I know and what you would certainly say if my father were not by,-269.58099999999996
 Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ said Frank Churchill with a smile at Emma the person has not chosen ill,-241.27899999999997
 and so forth I always felt that something would happen in our favour and so it has you see,-235.156
 She will hardly be less hurt I suppose by Robert s marrying Lucy than she would have been by your marrying her,-266.817
 She was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing young woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have received the same compliment,-281.83000000000004
 Poor Jane Fairfax,-40.893
 Yes that he will,-53.93299999999999
 Go and eat and drink a little more and you will do very well,-167.98
 Mr Elton then turned back to accompany them,-101.191
 The young ladies arrived their appearance was by no means ungenteel or unfashionable,-150.944
 The fact is I suppose that she is tired of Enscombe,-136.69
 I wish his friends would propose it to him,-103.185
 She feared it was a strengthening regard,-80.527
 Dear me,-27.929000000000002
 I have been a little premature I perceive I beg your pardon,-126.82000000000001
 You will tell me I know that this may or may NOT have happened but I will listen to no cavil unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affair as satisfactory at this,-455.26300000000015
 She complained of it as they returned to Berkeley Street,-120.54200000000003
 I feel it so very due,-72.817
 A Mrs Elton would be an excuse for any change of intercourse former intimacy might sink without remark,-223.45299999999995
 Mr Knightley is not she,-58.501000000000005
 Edward saw enough to comprehend not only the meaning of others but such of Marianne s expressions as had puzzled him before and when their visitors left them he went immediately round her and said in a whisper I have been guessing,-516.3130000000001
 Captain Wentworth with five and twenty thousand pounds and as high in his profession as merit and activity could place him was no longer nobody,-309.33799999999997
 You know James Benwick,-49.592
 If she is really ill why not go to Bath Mr,-136.34
 Miss Bates was obliged to return without success Jane was quite unpersuadable the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her worse Emma wished she could have seen her and tried her own powers but almost before she could hint the wish Miss Bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on no account to let Miss Woodhouse in,-743.2230000000002
 My objection is this though I think very well of Mrs Jennings s heart she is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure or whose protection will give us consequence,-388.5420000000001
 Mr Weston directed the whole officiating safely between Hartfield and the Vicarage and every body was in good time,-226.704
 Mr Woodhouse saw the letter and he says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life,-216.76199999999997
 They were by no means tired of wondering and admiring and not even Louisa seemed to feel that they had parted with Captain Wentworth long when they saw him coming after them with three companions all well known already by description to be Captain and Mrs Harville and a Captain Benwick who was staying with them,-673.9560000000004
 He brought all the music to her and they looked it over together Emma took the opportunity of whispering,-232.43499999999995
 No letter from Willoughby came and none seemed expected by Marianne,-141.90300000000002
 She had seen him,-42.134
 Lord,-17.360999999999997
 I am ready said Emma whenever I am wanted,-107.272
 said Emma,-25.5
 Such attentions as Mrs Elton s I should have imagined would rather disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax,-206.07899999999998
 Be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited,-109.051
 How cheerful how animated how suspicious how busy their imaginations all are,-157.645
 Presently Mr Knightley looked back and came and sat down by her,-155.665
 CHAPTER XIV,-28.300999999999995
 The arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joy to him and in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitants he had now procured for his cottage at Barton,-451.1340000000001
 Her sensibility was potent enough,-68.608
 Nothing seemed amiss on the side of the Great House family which was generally as Anne very well knew the least to blame,-281.96299999999997
 I confess replied Elinor that every circumstance except ONE is in favour of their engagement but that ONE is the total silence of both on the subject and with me it almost outweighs every other,-421.791
 Tis twelve I shall not forget to think of you four hours hence and by this time to morrow perhaps or a little later I may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here,-435.52400000000006
 One says those sort of things of course without any idea of a serious meaning,-188.98399999999998
 A variety of occupations of objects and of company which could not be procured at Barton would be inevitable there and might yet she hoped cheat Marianne at times into some interest beyond herself and even into some amusement much as the ideas of both might now be spurned by her,-625.424
 you are not serious now,-65.09
 Harriet bore the intelligence very well blaming nobody and in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion of herself as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to her friend,-422.00800000000004
 I do not often walk this way now said Emma as they proceeded but then there will be an inducement and I shall gradually get intimately acquainted with all the hedges gates pools and pollards of this part of Highbury,-454.1220000000002
 I cannot make speeches Emma he soon resumed and in a tone of such sincere decided intelligible tenderness as was tolerably convincing If I loved you less I might be able to talk about it more,-426.315
 But it is done we are reconciled dearer much dearer than ever and no moment s uneasiness can ever occur between us again,-280.11
 In such a frame of mind as she was now in Elinor had no difficulty in obtaining from her whatever promise she required and at her request Marianne engaged never to speak of the affair to any one with the least appearance of bitterness to meet Lucy without betraying the smallest increase of dislike to her and even to see Edward himself if chance should bring them together without any diminution of her usual cordiality These were great concessions but where Marianne felt that she had injured no reparation could be too much for her to make,-1154.6940000000004
 I will not ask your opinion of it as a composition said Edward For worlds would not I have had a letter of hers seen by YOU in former days In a sister it is bad enough but in a wife how I have blushed over the pages of her writing and I believe I may say that since the first half year of our foolish business this is the only letter I ever received from her of which the substance made me any amends for the defect of the style,-1092.1610000000005
 What ever she might feel of brighter hope she betrayed nothing,-144.847
 But Mrs Dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either consideration,-108.96000000000001
 How little did I think The two Abbots and I ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by and Miss Nash came and scolded us away and staid to look through herself however she called me back presently and let me look too which was very good natured,-712.1040000000004
 As her eyes fell on him his seemed to be withdrawn from her,-163.696
 I have thought it all over I assure you and I can perfectly account for every thing that at first seemed strange to me as well as to you,-316.49999999999994
 Good or bad,-46.157
 He soon quitted Bath and on Mrs Clay s quitting it soon afterwards and being next heard of as established under his protection in London it was evident how double a game he had been playing and how determined he was to save himself from being cut out by one artful woman at least,-664.3750000000002
 Marianne gave one glance round the apartment as she entered it was enough HE was not there and she sat down equally ill disposed to receive or communicate pleasure,-361.6780000000001
 She has plenty of money and I intend she shall buy all the high priced things I have in hand now,-261.294
 If you will have such ideas,-73.34700000000001
 They met readily and smiling but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said and having all sat down again there was for some time such a blank in the circle that Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged which she had long felt of seeing Frank Churchill once more and of seeing him with Jane would yield its proportion of pleasure,-816.6170000000002
 She was not a woman of many words for unlike people in general she proportioned them to the number of her ideas and of the few syllables that did escape her not one fell to the share of Miss Dashwood whom she eyed with the spirited determination of disliking her at all events,-622.6710000000003
 Like other great men under reverses he added with a smile,-141.502
 I have nothing to do with William s wants but it really is of very great importance that I should see Knightley to day and it becomes a matter therefore of very serious inconvenience that I should have had this hot walk to no purpose,-531.0430000000002
 Marianne coloured as she replied But most people do,-119.27400000000003
 On your side my love it was very innocently done,-127.484
 Quite worn out and broken up,-85.406
 The next morning produced no abatement in these happy symptoms,-124.541
 replied Emma unable to guess by look or voice whether Harriet could indeed have received any hint,-224.44299999999998
 She is still nearer And I do not know whether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body,-323.21500000000003
 But upon my soul I did NOT know it he warmly replied I did not recollect that I had omitted to give her my direction and common sense might have told her how to find it out,-441.656
 The tenderest caresses followed this confession,-79.479
 Where could have been the attraction,-76.39
 It would be unnecessary I am sure for you to caution Mrs Palmer and Sir John against ever naming Mr Willoughby or making the slightest allusion to what has passed before my sister,-391.25100000000003
 MY girls were nothing to her and yet they used to be foolish enough but as for Miss Marianne she is quite an altered creature,-308.61500000000007
 Whereas in my opinion by her taking so much notice of you and treating you in this kind of way she has given you a sort of claim on her future consideration which a conscientious woman would not disregard,-474.2460000000001
 There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are,-132.754
 No I have no idea of being so easily persuaded,-111.906
 She has been indisposed all day and we have persuaded her to go to bed,-175.33800000000002
 There is my news I thought it would interest you said Mr Knightley with a smile which implied a conviction of some part of what had passed between them,-328.97800000000007
 Troubles soon arose,-41.646
 Mrs Goddard and the teachers and the girls and the affairs of the school in general formed naturally a great part of the conversation and but for her acquaintance with the Martins of Abbey Mill Farm it must have been the whole,-484.66600000000005
 What,-14.716
 I have been always telling you my love that I had no idea of the change being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended and now you have Emma s account I hope you will be satisfied,-431.01600000000013
 I have no patience with him,-58.82299999999999
 What else can detain him at Norland,-92.642
 CHAPTER 14,-22.075000000000003
 But then at other times I have not resolution enough for it I cannot bear the thoughts of making him so miserable as I know the very mention of such a thing would do,-403.192
 I would do more than for my own,-93.152
 Their union she believed could not divide her more from other men than their final separation,-209.63799999999998
 And he smiled with such seeming pleasure at the conviction that she must proceed another step,-201.77599999999995
 We are expecting a brother of Mrs Croft s here soon I dare say you know him by name,-228.15900000000002
 Louisa could not listen at all to his account of a conversation which he had just held with Dr Shirley she was at a window looking out for Captain Wentworth and even Henrietta had at best only a divided attention to give and seemed to have forgotten all the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation,-671.8170000000001
 Henrietta conscious and ashamed and seeing no cousin Charles walking along any path or leaning against any gate was ready to do as Mary wished but No,-345.017
 Every friend of Miss Taylor must be glad to have her so happily married,-167.554
 Elinor tried to make a civil answer though doubting her own success,-151.26900000000003
 What a pity it is that Mr Weston ever thought of her,-136.251
 Charles if you see Captain Harville anywhere remember to give Miss Anne s message,-184.237
 and is not that the commonest infirmity of declining life,-130.585
 With an income quite sufficient to their wants thus secured to them they had nothing to wait for after Edward was in possession of the living but the readiness of the house to which Colonel Brandon with an eager desire for the accommodation of Elinor was making considerable improvements and after waiting some time for their completion after experiencing as usual a thousand disappointments and delays from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen Elinor as usual broke through the first positive resolution of not marrying till every thing was ready and the ceremony took place in Barton church early in the autumn,-1257.226
 Harriet was one of those who having once begun would be always in love,-166.39300000000003
 Oh no,-24.296
 no that must have been quite accidental,-87.13000000000001
 Mrs Dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well as pleasure in the frequency of her visits at Delaford for her wish of bringing Marianne and Colonel Brandon together was hardly less earnest though rather more liberal than what John had expressed,-505.5510000000002
 Many circumstances assisted the temptation,-73.112
 I never saw any thing equal to the comfort and style Candles everywhere I was telling you of your grandmama Jane There was a little disappointment The baked apples and biscuits excellent in their way you know but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first and good Mr Woodhouse not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough sent it all out again,-800.6820000000002
 His card was on the table when they came in from the morning s drive,-183.304
 Well returning to the room I have not been able to succeed,-138.558
 Mr Elton was so hot and tired that all this wit seemed thrown away,-167.736
 A disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips but I am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood,-262.818
 yes perhaps it had been Mr Elliot,-87.81
 I see that more than a mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question and woe betide him and her too when it comes to things of consequence when they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and strength of mind if she have not resolution enough to resist idle interference in such a trifle as this,-707.6540000000003
 Upon my word she cried the young man is determined not to lose any thing for want of asking,-228.42799999999997
 how very odd,-44.208999999999996
 Anne s astonished air and exclamation of wonder made her pause and in a calmer manner she added,-225.26299999999998
 Ten minutes were enough to certify that,-93.381
 The girls were now hunting for the Laconia and Captain Wentworth could not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume into his own hands to save them the trouble and once more read aloud the little statement of her name and rate and present non commissioned class observing over it that she too had been one of the best friends man ever had,-778.2110000000002
 She must understand you,-47.369
 She talked with a great deal of reason and at least equal affection but she had too much to urge for Emma s attention it was soon gone to Brunswick Square or to Donwell she forgot to attempt to listen and when Mrs Weston ended with We have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for you know but I hope it will soon come she was obliged to pause before she answered and at last obliged to answer at random before she could at all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for,-1182.348
 CHARADE,-13.251999999999999
 You are very much mistaken,-52.872
 Indeed Marianne I think you are mistaken,-84.84400000000001
 If I loved a man as she loves the Admiral I would always be with him nothing should ever separate us and I would rather be overturned by him than driven safely by anybody else,-426.824
 It is not now worth a regret said Emma,-103.13900000000001
 We should not like her so well as we do sir if we could suppose it but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor s advantage she knows how very acceptable it must be at Miss Taylor s time of life to be settled in a home of her own and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure,-923.0530000000002
 To understand thoroughly understand her own heart was the first endeavour,-137.988
 Here however Elinor perceived not the language not the professions of Colonel Brandon but the natural embellishments of her mother s active fancy which fashioned every thing delightful to her as it chose,-403.3530000000002
 It soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement,-121.477
 To the former her raillery was probably as far as it regarded only himself perfectly indifferent but to the latter it was at first incomprehensible and when its object was understood she hardly knew whether most to laugh at its absurdity or censure its impertinence for she considered it as an unfeeling reflection on the colonel s advanced years and on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor,-837.4770000000005
 That he is patronised by YOU replied Willoughby is certainly in his favour but as for the esteem of the others it is a reproach in itself,-327.03
 Captain Benwick is very well I believe but he is a very odd young man,-172.661
 Well said she and you soon silenced Mr Cole I suppose,-134.81900000000002
 Thank you,-28.68
 All the better,-40.088
 I assure you I heard of it in my way through town,-131.132
 When he was speaking of it in that way I honestly said that the world I could give up parties balls plays for I had no fear of retirement,-348.7790000000001
 We shall have him very thankful to anybody that will bring him his wife,-173.721
 Ten minutes would have been all that was necessary perhaps all that was proper and I had told my father I should certainly be at home before him but there was no getting away no pause and to my utter astonishment I found when he finding me nowhere else joined me there at last that I had been actually sitting with them very nearly three quarters of an hour,-818.8670000000003
 This must have been about that very period of Mr Elliot s life said Anne which has always excited my particular curiosity,-267.453
 On THAT head therefore it was not for her to oppose her mother s intention of removing into Devonshire,-229.01299999999995
 If it were war now he would have settled it long ago,-145.495
 They spoke therefore of Mrs Churchill s death with mutual forbearance,-138.294
 Their concerns had been sunk under those of Uppercross and when Lady Russell reverted to their former hopes and fears and spoke her satisfaction in the house in Camden Place which had been taken and her regret that Mrs Clay should still be with them Anne would have been ashamed to have it known how much more she was thinking of Lyme and Louisa Musgrove and all her acquaintance there how much more interesting to her was the home and the friendship of the Harvilles and Captain Benwick than her own father s house in Camden Place or her own sister s intimacy with Mrs Clay,-1254.5259999999998
 Something has happened to delay her some visitors perhaps,-120.95500000000001
 Perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more because he was slighted by Willoughby and Marianne who prejudiced against him for being neither lively nor young seemed resolved to undervalue his merits,-400.6560000000002
 The village of Barton was chiefly on one of these hills and formed a pleasant view from the cottage windows,-248.12699999999998
 Miss Dashwood at this point turning her eyes on him with the most angry contempt stopped him by saying,-232.05699999999996
 Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story,-158.619
 Miss Elliot said he speaking rather low you have done a good deed in making that poor fellow talk so much,-265.09299999999996
 She could scarcely imagine a more cheerless situation in itself than Mrs Smith s,-169.61100000000002
 Mrs Dashwood was sorry for what she had said but it gave Elinor pleasure as it produced a reply from Marianne so expressive of confidence in Willoughby and knowledge of his intentions,-382.547
 I do not pretend to fix on times or places but I must tell you that I have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of something to her advantage,-374.678
 and the two new beauties with the tall Irish officer who is talked of for one of them,-222.484
 His understanding was good and his education had given it solid improvement,-155.013
 Selina is no fine lady I assure you,-102.526
 He meant not to be unkind however and as a mark of his affection for the three girls he left them a thousand pounds a piece,-309.449
 I am sure you will like it of all things,-99.526
 or a shark,-45.618
 And on my own account too so dear as he is to me I don t think I could be equal to it,-273.08500000000004
 My dear Madam I always say to her you must make yourself easy,-160.62099999999998
 They were speaking as they drew near,-83.881
 You must be the best judge of your own happiness,-112.089
 You shall have a charming wife,-75.884
 It was quite out of the benevolence of her heart that she had asked these young women to her house merely because she thought they deserved some attention were harmless well behaved girls and would be pleasant companions for otherwise we both wished very much to have invited you and Marianne to be with us while your kind friend there was attending her daughter,-765.3610000000004
 I never saw you wear a ring before Edward she cried,-132.223
 Sir Walter his two daughters and Mrs Clay were the earliest of all their party at the rooms in the evening and as Lady Dalrymple must be waited for they took their station by one of the fires in the Octagon Room,-499.348
 It was an unsuitable connexion and did not produce much happiness,-128.43
 The event however was most joyful and every day was giving her fresh reason for thinking so Harriet s parentage became known,-276.406
 I am all amazement,-45.452999999999996
 You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax sir are you,-120.87
 I can easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my mother but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs,-386.6650000000001
 It is like a woman s writing,-83.13000000000001
 It is early,-34.499
 So far all was perfectly right but Lady Russell was almost startled by the wrong of one part of the Kellynch Hall plan when it burst on her which was Mrs Clay s being engaged to go to Bath with Sir Walter and Elizabeth as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter in all the business before her,-707.4480000000001
 How could I look on without agony,-90.215
 Service,-13.251999999999999
 Within a few days after this meeting the newspapers announced to the world that the lady of Thomas Palmer Esq,-257.638
 I was at Plymouth dreading to hear of him he sent in letters but the Grappler was under orders for Portsmouth,-252.24699999999996
 asked Elinor,-35.152
 And I really believe he HAS the most delicate conscience in the world the most scrupulous in performing every engagement however minute and however it may make against his interest or pleasure,-390.5480000000001
 It was a palpable display repeated on every possible occasion,-114.174
 They were of sobering tendency they allayed agitation they composed and consequently must make her happier,-200.35799999999998
 She was sensible of all the affection it evinced,-102.58200000000001
 It would be an interesting and certainly a very kind undertaking highly becoming her own situation in life her leisure and powers,-263.17299999999994
 She was disgustingly was suspiciously reserved,-70.301
 But what are you in doubt of,-85.48
 Compare their manner of carrying themselves of walking of speaking of being silent,-166.211
 You may believe how glad we all were to see them added Mrs Jennings leaning forward towards Elinor and speaking in a low voice as if she meant to be heard by no one else though they were seated on different sides of the room but however I can t help wishing they had not travelled quite so fast nor made such a long journey of it for they came all round by London upon account of some business for you know nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter it was wrong in her situation,-1149.1680000000001
 But you you above all above my mother had been wronged by me,-155.512
 There had been no real affection either in his language or manners,-147.169
 Is it impossible to,-53.708
 It was all my doing I know,-78.569
 At any rate said Elinor wishing to prevent Mrs Jennings from seeing her sister s thoughts as clearly as she did I dare say we shall have Sir John and Lady Middleton in town by the end of next week,-466.096
 The anxious cares the incessant attentions of Mrs Weston were not thrown away,-158.052
 His father very much wished him to meet Captain Wentworth and there being no sufficient reason against it he ought to go and it ended in his making a bold public declaration when he came in from shooting of his meaning to dress directly and dine at the other house,-604.7740000000001
 It was only necessary to mention any favourite amusement to engage her to talk,-169.374
 Well I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland,-132.90400000000002
 Witness this very time,-54.303
 Elton She looked round for a moment he had joined Mr Knightley at a little distance and was arranging himself for settled conversation while smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife,-412.049
 But you will come again said Emma,-82.959
 We were asked on purpose to be introduced,-95.005
 She checked herself however and submitted quietly to a little more praise than she deserved,-185.325
 This circumstance was a growing attachment between her eldest girl and the brother of Mrs John Dashwood a gentleman like and pleasing young man who was introduced to their acquaintance soon after his sister s establishment at Norland and who had since spent the greatest part of his time there,-602.702
 And he is a very clever boy indeed,-95.60600000000001
 Has Perry seen her,-58.099
 This wretched note was the finale of Emma s breakfast,-120.58999999999999
 replied Lucy I wonder at that for I thought you must have seen her at Norland sometimes,-211.559
 Yes yes to the inn repeated Captain Wentworth comparatively collected and eager to be doing something,-198.915
 I wish I could conjecture how soon I shall make this rivet quite firm,-169.42499999999998
 If you want any farther explanation continued he smiling they are paid for it,-174.578
 Their being fixed so absolutely fixed in the same place was bad for each for all three,-215.47399999999996
 For God s sake tell me is she out of danger or is she not,-191.95
 I never could have been happy with him after knowing as sooner or later I must have known all this I should have had no confidence no esteem,-325.19200000000006
 My dear sir you are too obliging Is there nobody you would not rather I am not helpless,-209.432
 Colonel Brandon s character said Elinor as an excellent man is well established,-160.95899999999997
 I dare say Mr Knightley will be so kind as to meet him,-140.708
 CHAPTER XIX,-22.075000000000003
 He was recalled from wit to wisdom not by any reproof of her s but by his own sensibility,-228.91699999999997
 The Admiral s kind urgency came in support of his wife s they would not be refused they compressed themselves into the smallest possible space to leave her a corner and Captain Wentworth without saying a word turned to her and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage,-589.5480000000001
 She could not but hear she could not avoid answering,-104.17100000000002
 And who do you think came in while we were there,-133.07100000000003
 Do look at it,-52.967999999999996
 I have not said exert yourself Harriet for my sake think less talk less of Mr Elton for my sake because for your own sake rather I would wish it to be done for the sake of what is more important than my comfort a habit of self command in you a consideration of what is your duty an attention to propriety an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others to save your health and credit and restore your tranquillity,-960.9649999999999
 Chapter 8,-31.641
 The want of proper families in the place and the conviction that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted to attend were mentioned but he was not satisfied,-387.699
 She had wandered away to a subject on which Elinor had nothing to say and therefore soon judged it expedient to find her way back again to the first,-343.276
 For a moment or two nothing was said and she was unsuspicious of having excited any particular interest till she found her arm drawn within his and pressed against his heart and heard him thus saying in a tone of great sensibility speaking low,-532.4080000000001
 She took them all most affectionately by the hand and expressed great delight in seeing them again,-211.14399999999998
 He saw that Emma had soon made it out and found it highly entertaining though it was something which she judged it proper to appear to censure for she said Nonsense,-381.79300000000006
 She had too old a regard for him to be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish every past hope and leave him nothing to do but to keep away from Uppercross but there was such a change as became very alarming when such a man as Captain Wentworth was to be regarded as the probable cause,-690.474
 He has been used to her in these complaints and I hope to morrow morning will bring us both a more comfortable report,-274.896
 Anne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification of finding such words applied to her father,-216.823
 I can hardly believe it I thought I knew him,-115.20800000000001
 I smile because you smile and shall probably suspect whatever I find you suspect but at present I do not see what there is to question,-318.31299999999993
 If she is ill I should be sorry to do her injustice but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to speak of her with the forbearance I could wish,-419.74300000000017
 But Harriet is it necessary to burn the court plaister I have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil but the court plaister might be useful,-357.7540000000001
 He was in orders and having a curacy in the neighbourhood where residence was not required lived at his father s house only two miles from Uppercross,-321.19899999999996
 They were engaged about the end of that time to attend Lady Middleton to a party from which Mrs Jennings was kept away by the indisposition of her youngest daughter and for this party Marianne wholly dispirited careless of her appearance and seeming equally indifferent whether she went or staid prepared without one look of hope or one expression of pleasure,-743.3030000000005
 She often says when the letter is first opened Well Hetty now I think you will be put to it to make out all that checker work don t you ma am And then I tell her I am sure she would contrive to make it out herself if she had nobody to do it for her every word of it I am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word,-885.949
 When did that happen,-56.87499999999999
 She declared them to be very agreeable girls indeed which for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration,-194.1
 What a disappointment it would be,-69.10699999999999
 We will walk to the farm at the edge of the down and see how the children go on we will walk to Sir John s new plantations at Barton Cross and the Abbeyland and we will often go the old ruins of the Priory and try to trace its foundations as far as we are told they once reached,-694.6000000000003
 No I do not know that Mr Wingfield considers it very sickly except,-146.371
 But it was NOT Colonel Brandon neither his air nor his height,-148.437
 She played and sang and drew in almost every style but steadiness had always been wanting and in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she would have been glad to command and ought not to have failed of,-491.56300000000016
 But as she wanted to be drawing the declaration must wait a little longer,-169.064
 Either in the morning or evening of every day excepting one have we seen either Mr Weston or Mrs Weston and generally both either at Randalls or here and as you may suppose Isabella most frequently here,-461.03400000000005
 But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles,-138.76100000000002
 I am glad of it,-46.714
 And how he had been so worried by what passed that as soon as he had went away from his mother s house he had got upon his horse and rid into the country some where or other and how he had stayed about at an inn all Thursday and Friday on purpose to get the better of it,-684.9190000000003
 Here Mrs Jennings ceased and as Elinor had had time enough to collect her thoughts she was able to give such an answer and make such observations as the subject might naturally be supposed to produce,-443.5820000000001
 Emma even jumped with surprize and horror struck exclaimed,-118.07100000000001
 He could not be persuaded that so many good looking houses as he saw around him could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting and even when particulars were given and families described he was still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing or that there would be the smallest difficulty in every body s returning into their proper place the next morning,-842.8900000000004
 Sir John could do no more but he did not know that any more was required to be together was in his opinion to be intimate and while his continual schemes for their meeting were effectual he had not a doubt of their being established friends,-537.9600000000002
 I have had a little knowledge of their methods of doing business and I am free to confess that they have very liberal notions and are as likely to make desirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with,-488.3850000000001
 But there was another and an earlier which I will now explain,-149.924
 If she could only have a few minutes conversation with him again she fancied she should be satisfied and as to the power of addressing him she felt all over courage if the opportunity occurred,-421.3200000000001
 Nay said Anne I have no particular enquiry to make about her,-151.465
 But it shall be regulated it shall be checked by religion by reason by constant employment,-197.599
 Oh Mrs Churchill every body knows Mrs Churchill replied Isabella and I am sure I never think of that poor young man without the greatest compassion,-309.28300000000013
 You had rather take evil upon credit than good,-113.334
 He could not meet her in conversation rational or playful,-121.62600000000002
 How unlucky that is,-54.43599999999999
 But when there is plenty of money on one side and next to none on the other Lord bless you,-240.90999999999997
 How can she find any appellation for them deep enough in familiar vulgarity,-167.15599999999998
 This is always my luck,-62.568
 The two grandmothers with not less partiality but more sincerity were equally earnest in support of their own descendant,-235.03400000000002
 I will attack them with more address,-85.924
 you are too scrupulous indeed you are cried Emma warmly and taking her hand,-176.28899999999996
 To Marianne he merely bowed and said nothing,-101.666
 THAT I will never consent to,-87.01400000000001
 We are so very airy,-65.42
 She had only to submit sit down be outwardly composed and feel herself plunged at once in all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of tasting a little before the morning closed,-421.1330000000001
 Lady Russell and Anne paid their compliments to them once when Anne could not but feel that Uppercross was already quite alive again,-279.519
 She could not have called it either cold or friendly or anything so certainly as embarrassed,-189.725
 worse than cold hearted,-63.269999999999996
 She would have ordered the carriage and come to you but she must see you alone and that you know nodding towards her father Humph Can you come,-334.80799999999994
 Emma could not deplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment,-168.032
 They hardly can satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings standing in a mother s place but without a mother s affection to blind her,-348.0109999999999
 Mrs Jennings soon appeared and the note being given her she read it aloud,-175.23799999999997
 But they have a great many to provide for and among the thousands that may just as well go to the bottom as not it is impossible for them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed,-464.9450000000001
 Yes and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays,-142.70900000000003
 Remember Elinor said she how very often Sir John fetches our letters himself from the post and carries them to it,-262.523
 There will be but one subject throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury but one interest one object of curiosity it will be all Mr Frank Churchill we shall think and speak of nobody else,-414.476
 Does Mrs Churchill do the same,-81.49399999999999
 I have not known him long indeed but I am much better acquainted with him than I am with any other creature in the world except yourself and mama,-326.14700000000005
 I know you will soon call on her she is living in dread of the visit,-184.06800000000004
 Does she never mean to go away,-91.76799999999999
 So early too,-43.518
 Such for half an hour was the conversation interrupted only once by Mrs Weston who came out in her solicitude after her son in law to inquire if he were come and she was a little uneasy She had some fears of his horse,-528.0550000000001
 Perry does not call it altogether a sickly season,-123.23300000000002
 You have many parties of that kind here I suppose Miss Woodhouse every summer,-172.10899999999995
 He was delighted with every thing admired Hartfield sufficiently for Mr Woodhouse s ear and when their going farther was resolved on confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than Emma could have supposed,-563.6600000000002
 Jane don t you remember grandmama s telling us of it when we got home,-194.032
 She tried to be calm and leave things to take their course and tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence Surely if there be constant attachment on each side our hearts must understand each other ere long,-495.57300000000015
 Elinor wished very much to ask whether Willoughby were then in town but she was afraid of giving him pain by any enquiry after his rival and at length by way of saying something she asked if he had been in London ever since she had seen him last,-581.122
 Conversation however was not wanted for Sir John was very chatty and Lady Middleton had taken the wise precaution of bringing with her their eldest child a fine little boy about six years old by which means there was one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case of extremity for they had to enquire his name and age admire his beauty and ask him questions which his mother answered for him while he hung about her and held down his head to the great surprise of her ladyship who wondered at his being so shy before company as he could make noise enough at home,-1318.862
 Without scruple without apology without much apparent diffidence Mr Elton the lover of Harriet was professing himself her lover,-249.53799999999995
 We do not live a great way from him in the country you know,-165.169
 Some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed and others of the son and the uncle not letting him,-297.92300000000006
 That is as formidable an image as you could present Harriet and if I thought I should ever be like Miss Bates,-263.394
 There is no doubt of your doing exceedingly well quite as well or better perhaps all things considered,-215.16299999999995
 However as they are so very desirous to have dear Emma dine with them and as you will both be there and Mr Knightley too to take care of her I cannot wish to prevent it provided the weather be what it ought neither damp nor cold nor windy,-590.3170000000002
 Mrs Perry was always particularly fond of my mother indeed I do not know who is not and she had mentioned it to her in confidence she had no objection to her telling us of course but it was not to go beyond and from that day to this I never mentioned it to a soul that I know of,-688.3190000000001
 Relate only what in your conscience you think necessary for me to hear,-159.54500000000002
 Well I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out,-321.46
 With all my heart,-47.07900000000001
 She was particularly asked to meet Mr Elliot and be introduced to Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret who were fortunately already engaged to come and she could not have received a more gratifying attention,-387.289
 Barton Park was about half a mile from the cottage,-130.66400000000002
 Young ladies should take care of themselves Young ladies are delicate plants,-149.951
 Every body must have seen the snow coming on,-113.596
 The pity of such a woman as Lady Middleton,-100.589
 They were now approaching the cottage and all idle topics were superseded,-146.155
 She must not flatter herself that he thought of her dancing but if he were criticising her behaviour she did not feel afraid,-265.36600000000004
 Their time and strength and spirits were therefore exactly ready for this walk and they entered into it with pleasure,-256.014
 Edward was of course immediately convinced that nothing could have been more natural than Lucy s conduct nor more self evident than the motive of it,-316.6960000000001
 You pass it over very handsomely but you were perfectly right,-138.31199999999998
 Look at her,-41.823
 It was no insignificant barrier indeed,-64.489
 Mrs Weston sees no objection to it provided you are satisfied,-136.696
 Anne was startled and confused but after standing in a moment s suspense was obliged and not sorry to be obliged to hurry away,-283.45
 The very next day however produced some proof of inspiration,-123.087
 In one respect he is the object of my envy,-120.32300000000002
 And yet it is not very unlikely,-80.46700000000001
 How it would affect Frank was among the earliest thoughts of both,-152.109
 How often did I wish added he when I was at Allenham this time twelvemonth that Barton cottage were inhabited,-250.57099999999994
 I cannot see you acting wrong without a remonstrance,-111.36600000000001
 At the same time I will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint because I know I do sometimes pop out a thing before I am aware,-363.088
 I detest jargon of every kind and sometimes I have kept my feelings to myself because I could find no language to describe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning,-450.7080000000001
 Give me the book I will write it down and then there can be no possible reflection on you,-239.57899999999998
 The most satisfactory comparisons were rising in her mind,-112.90700000000001
 I brought her into Plymouth and here another instance of luck,-139.643
 How very odd,-36.863
 She was stopped by a cough,-63.905
 It chiefly consisted of household linen plate china and books with a handsome pianoforte of Marianne s,-213.88099999999997
 She must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction,-106.53000000000002
 she cried with a most open eagerness Never for the twentieth part of a moment did such an idea occur to me,-268.55199999999996
 He longed to see her,-58.644000000000005
 He promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off said he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment that I might see it and if I do not turn back now I have no chance,-511.7740000000001
 Such a heart is very little worth having is it Lady Russell,-149.216
 As to the pretence of trying her native air I look upon that as a mere excuse In the summer it might have passed but what can any body s native air do for them in the months of January February and March,-525.1830000000003
 Poor dear Jane was talking of it just now You must go said she,-174.85
 Soon after this Miss Bates came in and Emma could not help being diverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself resulting she supposed from doubt of what might be said and impatience to say every thing,-471.546
 She insisted on being left behind the next morning when the others went out,-171.361
 How very pleasing and proper of him,-87.172
 The little she said was all in lamentation of this inevitable delay though Elinor tried to raise her spirits and make her believe as she THEN really believed herself that it would be a very short one,-430.22
 What can it be Miss Woodhouse what can it be,-118.996
 it would be a capital match for either of his sisters,-131.168
 It was some comfort to him that many inquiries after himself and Miss Woodhouse for his neighbours knew that he loved to be inquired after as well as Miss Smith were coming in during the rest of the day and he had the pleasure of returning for answer that they were all very indifferent which though not exactly true for she was perfectly well and Harriet not much otherwise Emma would not interfere with,-852.6740000000002
 No the young lady to be sure,-82.13400000000001
 But her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed she is so very reserved so very unwilling to give the least information about any body that I really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance with her,-502.02
 A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance to be married to a respectable intelligent gentleman farmer,-185.68099999999998
 He addressed her with easy civility and twisted his head into a bow which assured her as plainly as words could have done that he was exactly the coxcomb she had heard him described to be by Lucy,-472.01000000000016
 Miss Dashwood do you think people make love when any body else is by,-173.9
 Do you really think it a bad thing why so,-121.16000000000003
 And those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while whenever there is any temptation of pleasure,-228.27899999999994
 Mrs John Knightley was delighted to be of use any thing of ill health was a recommendation to her and though not so fond of a dentist as of a Mr Wingfield she was quite eager to have Harriet under her care When it was thus settled on her sister s side Emma proposed it to her friend and found her very persuadable Harriet was to go she was invited for at least a fortnight she was to be conveyed in Mr Woodhouse s carriage It was all arranged it was all completed and Harriet was safe in Brunswick Square,-1164.0949999999998
 Beyond it she would on no account proceed,-110.32700000000001
 Marianne was vexed at it for her sister s sake and turned her eyes towards Elinor to see how she bore these attacks with an earnestness which gave Elinor far more pain than could arise from such common place raillery as Mrs Jennings s,-529.0480000000002
 But while she smiled at a graciousness so misapplied she could not reflect on the mean spirited folly from which it sprung nor observe the studied attentions with which the Miss Steeles courted its continuance without thoroughly despising them all four,-504.50400000000025
 It was hardly right but it had been so strong an idea that it would escape her and his submission to all that she told was a compliment to her penetration which made it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue,-555.889
 Mrs Weston would be at ease,-68.494
 After this had been settled Colonel Brandon began to talk of his own advantage in securing so respectable and agreeable a neighbour and THEN it was that he mentioned with regret that the house was small and indifferent an evil which Elinor as Mrs Jennings had supposed her to do made very light of at least as far as regarded its size,-750.6290000000001
 Shall I call upon them,-69.337
 But do come in,-50.82599999999999
 Marianne assented most feelingly to the remark and her mother was led by it to an enumeration of Colonel Brandon s injuries and merits warm as friendship and design could unitedly dictate,-390.98700000000014
 But how can it be done,-70.648
 Nancy she fell upon her knees and cried bitterly and your brother he walked about the room and said he did not know what to do,-302.43699999999995
 It was an afternoon of distress and Anne had every thing to do at once the apothecary to send for the father to have pursued and informed the mother to support and keep from hysterics the servants to control the youngest child to banish and the poor suffering one to attend and soothe besides sending as soon as she recollected it proper notice to the other house which brought her an accession rather of frightened enquiring companions than of very useful assistants,-991.6030000000004
 I have thought only of you,-63.807
 He rose up and walked across the room,-94.583
 Lady Dalrymple had acquired the name of a charming woman because she had a smile and a civil answer for everybody,-256.231
 Charles ring and order a chair,-81.934
 They shall no longer worry others nor torture myself,-115.99500000000002
 They were all in high spirits and good humour eager to be happy and determined to submit to the greatest inconveniences and hardships rather than be otherwise,-320.746
 It would have been such a great pity to have went away before your brother and sister came,-204.87099999999998
 Such an adventure as this a fine young man and a lovely young woman thrown together in such a way could hardly fail of suggesting certain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain,-422.11800000000005
 She rated Lady Russell s influence highly and as to the severe degree of self denial which her own conscience prompted she believed there might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete than to half a reformation,-481.03599999999994
 He made no reply his complexion changed and all his embarrassment returned but as if on catching the eye of the young lady with whom he had been previously talking he felt the necessity of instant exertion he recovered himself again and after saying Yes I had the pleasure of receiving the information of your arrival in town which you were so good as to send me turned hastily away with a slight bow and joined his friend,-930.3700000000003
 Understanding and gratification came together,-64.319
 The name of Walter I can drop thank God,-112.88900000000001
 He came to their father upon some business and he asked him to stay to dinner,-194.486
 I wished very much to call upon you yesterday said he but it was impossible for we were obliged to take Harry to see the wild beasts at Exeter Exchange and we spent the rest of the day with Mrs Ferrars,-473.28700000000003
 And who is Willoughby,-51.526
 Say No if it is to be said,-91.18100000000001
 Did you ever hear of that A water party and by some accident she was falling overboard,-212.584
 She was short plump and fair with a fine bloom blue eyes light hair regular features and a look of great sweetness and before the end of the evening Emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person and quite determined to continue the acquaintance,-556.2529999999999
 I think Miss Fairfax dances very well and Mrs Weston is the very best country dance player without exception in England,-243.44899999999996
 And what are we to do for a proper partner for her,-144.61700000000002
 I expected much pleasure in it but I have found none,-129.559
 The friendliness of his disposition made him happy in accommodating those whose situation might be considered in comparison with the past as unfortunate,-288.18800000000005
 The purity of her life the formality of her notions her ignorance of the world every thing was against me,-231.576
 You and Miss Smith and Miss Fairfax will be three and the two Miss Coxes five had been repeated many times over,-264.45599999999996
 Such opposition as these feelings produced was more than Anne could combat,-154.736
 do you recommend this side Well I am sure Mr Churchill only it seems too good but just as you please,-261.81699999999995
 Anne was amused by Henrietta s manner of being grateful and amused also that the course of events and the new interests of Henrietta s views should have placed her friend at all in favour with any of the Musgrove family she had only time however for a general answer and a wish that such another woman were at Uppercross before all subjects suddenly ceased on seeing Louisa and Captain Wentworth coming towards them,-910.9250000000002
 You could not have visited me,-70.869
 My dear Emma your own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came to the point,-212.49800000000002
 When the evening was over Anne could not but be amused at the idea of her coming to Lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man whom she had never seen before nor could she help fearing on more serious reflection that like many other great moralists and preachers she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct would ill bear examination,-783.3030000000002
 It is but a cottage she continued but I hope to see many of my friends in it,-209.95500000000004
 But I shall want the ribbon directly so it had better go to Hartfield at least the ribbon,-219.128
 cried Margaret how happy I should be,-88.059
 It was his jealousy of Frank Churchill that had taken him from the country The Box Hill party had decided him on going away,-286.41799999999995
 said Emma playfully,-39.961
 She expressly conditioned however for paying no visits and would do no more than accompany them to Gray s in Sackville Street where Elinor was carrying on a negotiation for the exchange of a few old fashioned jewels of her mother,-492.0720000000002
 I hardly know how it has happened a little perhaps from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was by her aunt and grandmother and all their set,-535.9460000000003
 You forget how time passes,-66.527
 I wonder whether it is so,-67.511
 I do not consider myself at all a fortunate person,-110.387
 The invitation was general and generally declined,-88.137
 She left it all behind her all but the recollection that such things had been,-189.51600000000002
 I must love him and now that I am satisfied on one point the one material point I am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well and ready to hope that it may,-409.408
 Mrs Jennings however with a kindness of heart which made Elinor really love her declared her resolution of not stirring from Cleveland as long as Marianne remained ill and of endeavouring by her own attentive care to supply to her the place of the mother she had taken her from and Elinor found her on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate desirous to share in all her fatigues and often by her better experience in nursing of material use,-995.6400000000004
 As Louisa improved he had improved and he was now quite a different creature from what he had been the first week,-257.09400000000005
 As for Lucy Steele she considered her so totally unamiable so absolutely incapable of attaching a sensible man that she could not be persuaded at first to believe and afterwards to pardon any former affection of Edward for her,-465.26000000000005
 Every body had a degree of gravity and sorrow tenderness towards the departed solicitude for the surviving friends and in a reasonable time curiosity to know where she would be buried,-373.067
 Emma had hardly expected them for Mr Weston who had called in for half a minute in order to hear that his son was very handsome knew nothing of their plans and it was an agreeable surprize to her therefore to perceive them walking up to the house together arm in arm,-615.3380000000002
 Elinor cried Marianne is this fair,-81.255
 She has a great deal too much of the Elliot pride,-118.706
 To enquire after Marianne was at first his excuse but the encouragement of his reception to which every day gave greater kindness made such an excuse unnecessary before it had ceased to be possible by Marianne s perfect recovery,-487.3620000000001
 The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of Harriet s welfare she was really in danger of becoming too happy for security What had she to wish for,-378.5930000000001
 Here is a nut said he catching one down from an upper bough,-169.28
 But the whole of their behaviour to each other has been unaccountable,-139.49
 They were all thoughtless or indolent,-71.22
 We must be serious and decided for after all the person who has contracted debts must pay them and though a great deal is due to the feelings of the gentleman and the head of a house like your father there is still more due to the character of an honest man,-616.0519999999999
 Two thousand a year and then working himself up to a pitch of enthusiastic generosity he added Elinor I wish with all my heart it were TWICE as much for your sake,-396.027
 But if there should by any chance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty I should not think Colonel Brandon s being thirty five any objection to his marrying HER,-419.54100000000005
 We had better move on Mr Weston said she we are detaining the girls,-175.75599999999997
 She was not a woman of strong understanding or any quickness and with this resemblance of her father she inherited also much of his constitution was delicate in her own health over careful of that of her children had many fears and many nerves and was as fond of her own Mr Wingfield in town as her father could be of Mr Perry,-747.5630000000003
 There will be nothing singular in his case and it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering as it always does of our conduct,-339.094
 I dare say she had,-51.706
 The information was as you state that he was going to be married to a Miss Hawkins,-196.535
 Read it read it said he it will give you pleasure only a few lines will not take you long read it to Emma,-290.9879999999999
 A thousand vexatious thoughts would recur,-79.159
 But had I been informed of it a few hours earlier I think it is most probable that something might have been hit on,-288.09400000000005
 To judge from the Colonel s spirits however you have not yet made him equally sanguine,-200.85199999999998
 said Mrs Jennings without attending to her daughter s reproof,-123.891
 But SHE does every thing well,-78.744
 At first sight his address is certainly not striking and his person can hardly be called handsome till the expression of his eyes which are uncommonly good and the general sweetness of his countenance is perceived,-451.314
 He is a most amiable charming young man I believe,-112.339
 Is Mrs Ferrars at Longstaple,-69.69200000000001
 Do you call ME happy Marianne,-77.858
 No the years which had destroyed her youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing manly open look in no respect lessening his personal advantages,-345.38400000000007
 yes gloves and every thing,-63.901999999999994
 It was but a card party it was but a mixture of those who had never met before and those who met too often a commonplace business too numerous for intimacy too small for variety but Anne had never found an evening shorter,-518.7070000000002
 No man and woman would probably,-81.22399999999999
 Can you ma am,-49.604
 He might be only passing through,-73.218
 Had she tried to speak or had she been conscious of half Mrs Jennings s well meant but ill judged attentions to her this calmness could not have been maintained but not a syllable escaped her lips and the abstraction of her thoughts preserved her in ignorance of every thing that was passing before her,-653.7120000000002
 She seems quite recovered now,-64.406
 In a low cautious voice he said,-87.396
 poor fellow sad business for him She was extremely concerned for though very eccentric he had a thousand good qualities How could he be so taken in Did not think him at all in love not in the least Poor Knightley There would be an end of all pleasant intercourse with him How happy he had been to come and dine with them whenever they asked him,-813.4630000000003
 There she had listened to Henrietta s schemes for Dr Shirley s leaving Uppercross farther on she had first seen Mr Elliot a moment seemed all that could now be given to any one but Louisa or those who were wrapt up in her welfare,-556.3200000000002
 The evil of a marriage would be much diminished if Elizabeth were also to marry,-182.483
 Emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech from his wife,-194.346
 Vanity working on a weak head produces every sort of mischief,-148.871
 To provide for her otherwise was out of Colonel Campbell s power for though his income by pay and appointments was handsome his fortune was moderate and must be all his daughter s but by giving her an education he hoped to be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter,-607.6850000000002
 And secretly she added to herself Lord bless me,-113.80799999999999
 Dear Miss Woodhouse,-37.29
 Acquit me here and procure for me when it is allowable the acquittal and good wishes of that said Emma Woodhouse whom I regard with so much brotherly affection as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight you have now a key to,-741.7920000000004
 After these came a second set among the most come at able of whom were Mrs and Miss Bates and Mrs Goddard three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from Hartfield and who were fetched and carried home so often that Mr Woodhouse thought it no hardship for either James or the horses,-694.7150000000003
 Captain Wentworth jealous of her affection,-75.111
 Mr Willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to shew that house and as he went in an open carriage it was impossible to have any other companion,-379.16100000000006
 And the next news I suppose will be that we are to lose you just as I begin to know you,-255.22599999999997
 We have apple dumplings however very often,-88.48500000000001
 Yes said Mr John Knightley presently with some slyness he seems to have a great deal of good will towards you,-232.442
 Three days had passed without his coming once to Uppercross a most decided change,-186.01899999999998
 Anne thought she left great happiness behind her when they quitted the house and Louisa by whom she found herself walking burst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character of the navy their friendliness their brotherliness their openness their uprightness protesting that she was convinced of sailors having more worth and warmth than any other set of men in England that they only knew how to live and they only deserved to be respected and loved,-963.8500000000001
 However I think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again,-173.03900000000002
 Her pardon was duly begged at the close of the song and every thing usual followed,-200.63699999999997
 So seldom that any negligence or blunder appears,-106.80000000000001
 It shall be a regular party small but most elegant,-127.87200000000003
 I was afraid you would think I was taking a great liberty with you said she in telling you all this,-247.64799999999994
 She was obliged in spite of her previous determination to the contrary to do it all the justice that Mrs Weston foretold,-251.58899999999997
 continued Mrs Palmer then it must be some other place that is so pretty I suppose,-201.591
 Has she,-33.376
 I suppose he was afraid of finding it dull but upon my word I should have thought we were lively enough at the Cottage for such a heart broken man as Captain Benwick,-387.752
 Elinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settle at some distance from Norland than immediately amongst their present acquaintance,-283.193
 Your reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely,-117.19100000000002
 Knightley must never marry,-56.748000000000005
 Palmer,-22.136
 They were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more and yet perhaps by putting the children away in the maid s room or swinging a cot somewhere they could hardly bear to think of not finding room for two or three besides supposing they might wish to stay though with regard to any attendance on Miss Musgrove there need not be the least uneasiness in leaving her to Mrs Harville s care entirely,-907.5050000000002
 Her mind returned to Mrs Elton s offences and long very long did they occupy her,-195.71499999999997
 After some time spent in saying little or doing less Lady Middleton sat down to Cassino and as Marianne was not in spirits for moving about she and Elinor luckily succeeding to chairs placed themselves at no great distance from the table,-512.4890000000003
 At this moment I cannot recollect his name though I have heard it so lately,-180.27300000000002
 Here Frederick you and I part company I believe said she,-140.56300000000002
 Time passed on,-48.028
 I hope with all my heart the young man may be a Weston in merit and a Churchill in fortune But Harriet Smith I have not half done about Harriet Smith,-362.709
 But your father is not going so far he is only going to the Crown quite on the other side of the street and there are a great many houses you might be very much at a loss and it is a very dirty walk unless you keep on the footpath but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street,-753.2670000000002
 But the remembrance of the appeal remained a pleasure to her as a proof of friendship and of deference for her judgement a great pleasure and when it became a sort of parting proof its value did not lessen,-462.1240000000002
 Mrs Elton had received notice of it that morning and was in raptures,-158.12899999999996
 When I have seen Mr Elton replied Jane I dare say I shall be interested but I believe it requires that with me,-266.37999999999994
 Warmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still,-89.641
 We never heard of such things at Maple Grove,-108.039
 Nothing should tempt her to go if they did and she regretted that her father s known habits would be giving her refusal less meaning than she could wish,-355.785
 Well turning away now where are you bound,-106.274
 Excepting yourself and your brother I do not know his equal for temper,-159.289
 Of their personal charms he had not required a second interview to be convinced,-177.79099999999997
 or have you none but that of waiting for Mrs Ferrars s death which is a melancholy and shocking extremity Is her son determined to submit to this and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense in which it may involve you rather than run the risk of her displeasure for a while by owning the truth,-716.432
 They are as fine healthy children as ever were seen poor little dears,-162.61800000000002
 How long had Mr Knightley been so dear to her as every feeling declared him now to be,-219.402
 are you there But you are miserably behindhand,-110.917
 The comfort of such a friend at that moment as Colonel Brandon or such a companion for her mother how gratefully was it felt a companion whose judgment would guide whose attendance must relieve and whose friendship might soothe her as far as the shock of such a summons COULD be lessened to her his presence his manners his assistance would lessen it,-764.5830000000004
 Yet as she was convinced that Marianne s affection for Willoughby could leave no hope of Colonel Brandon s success whatever the event of that affection might be and at the same time wished to shield her conduct from censure she thought it most prudent and kind after some consideration to say more than she really knew or believed,-697.7140000000003
 The event had every promise of happiness for her friend,-123.39700000000002
 Ferrars,-19.692
 She rose early and wrote her letter to Harriet an employment which left her so very serious so nearly sad that Mr Knightley in walking up to Hartfield to breakfast did not arrive at all too soon and half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him literally and figuratively was quite necessary to reinstate her in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before,-864.9820000000004
 Mr Elliot talks unreservedly to Colonel Wallis of his views on you which said Colonel Wallis I imagine to be in himself a sensible careful discerning sort of character but Colonel Wallis has a very pretty silly wife to whom he tells things which he had better not and he repeats it all to her,-658.8080000000001
 No invitation came amiss to her,-75.809
 The good understanding between the Colonel and Miss Dashwood seemed rather to declare that the honours of the mulberry tree the canal and the yew arbour would all be made over to HER and Mrs Jennings had for some time ceased to think at all of Mrs Ferrars,-558.0819999999999
 You will have much pleasure in being in London and especially in being together and if Elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment she would foresee it there from a variety of sources she would perhaps expect some from improving her acquaintance with her sister in law s family,-593.4900000000001
 As Elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple of minutes without taking that liberty she begged to be excused,-255.83599999999993
 Her intentions were unchanged,-54.94799999999999
 cried Elinor have you been repeating to me what you only learnt yourself by listening at the door,-220.06899999999996
 Two or three more of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them and it was to be done in a quiet unpretending elegant way infinitely superior to the bustle and preparation the regular eating and drinking and picnic parade of the Eltons and the Sucklings,-568.7290000000003
 And I hope she is well,-64.616
 But what could I do we were engaged every thing in preparation the day almost fixed But I am talking like a fool,-281.267
 After a proper resistance on the part of Mrs Ferrars just so violent and so steady as to preserve her from that reproach which she always seemed fearful of incurring the reproach of being too amiable Edward was admitted to her presence and pronounced to be again her son,-604.5940000000002
 His opinion however made some little amends for his delay for though acknowledging a very unexpected and unpleasant alteration in his patient he would not allow the danger to be material and talked of the relief which a fresh mode of treatment must procure with a confidence which in a lesser degree was communicated to Elinor,-689.9720000000001
 They never could have been all three together without her having stabbed Jane Fairfax s peace in a thousand instances and on Box Hill perhaps it had been the agony of a mind that would bear no more,-453.2920000000001
 walking up that hill again would do her more harm than any sitting down could do her good and in short her look and manner declared that go she would not,-385.9820000000001
 The carriage is gone to day to bring Louisa and the Harvilles to morrow,-171.526
 But about the middle of the day she gets hungry and there is nothing she likes so well as these baked apples and they are extremely wholesome for I took the opportunity the other day of asking Mr Perry I happened to meet him in the street,-553.261
 I shall be no support to Mrs Weston,-85.77199999999999
 He had in fact been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence,-127.36700000000002
 Elinor had just been congratulating herself in the midst of her perplexity that however difficult it might be to express herself properly by letter it was at least preferable to giving the information by word of mouth when her visitor entered to force her upon this greatest exertion of all,-610.8260000000002
 The Colonel though disclaiming all pretensions to connoisseurship warmly admired the screens as he would have done any thing painted by Miss Dashwood and on the curiosity of the others being of course excited they were handed round for general inspection,-499.39400000000006
 Mr Suckling who has been eleven years a resident at Maple Grove and whose father had it before him I believe at least I am almost sure that old Mr Suckling had completed the purchase before his death,-471.43100000000015
 Which of the two sisters was preferred by Captain Wentworth was as yet quite doubtful as far as Anne s observation reached,-270.757
 I happened to be at Lyme,-66.282
 Nothing could be done without a reference to Elizabeth but her inclination was growing so strong for a removal that she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand and not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her,-535.6560000000001
 Such an extraordinary dream of mine,-79.62
 how those little fingers of yours fly about,-109.79500000000002
 Neither the dissipations of the past and she had lived very much in the world nor the restrictions of the present neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have closed her heart or ruined her spirits,-404.36600000000016
 He would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose,-150.291
 Mr Weston was a great favourite and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with such unreserve as to his wife not any one to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and understood of being always interesting and always intelligible the little affairs arrangements perplexities and pleasures of her father and herself,-703.2440000000003
 Mr Ferrars I believe is entirely dependent on his mother,-127.50100000000002
 There would have been either the ostentation of a coxcomb or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own vanities No I am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly,-400.201
 Her tears fell abundantly but her grief was so truly artless that no dignity could have made it more respectable in Emma s eyes and she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and understanding really for the time convinced that Harriet was the superior creature of the two and that to resemble her would be more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could do,-911.482
 Mrs Weston had been delighted before and was delighted again Emma joined her in all her praise and the pianoforte with every proper discrimination was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise,-403.2720000000001
 The next thing wanted was to get the picture framed and here were a few difficulties,-199.569
 What is the matter sir Did you speak to me,-116.96999999999998
 The character of his manner was embarrassment,-88.64000000000001
 It was an advantage that could not be too gratefully acknowledged nor too speedily made use of and the visit to Lady Middleton which had not before had any precise limits was instantly discovered to have been always meant to end in two days time,-535.2700000000001
 The unkindness of your own relations has made you astonished to find friendship any where,-188.226
 I shall wear a large bonnet and bring one of my little baskets hanging on my arm,-206.50299999999996
 Elinor joyfully profited by the first of these proposals and thus by a little of that address which Marianne could never condescend to practise gained her own end and pleased Lady Middleton at the same time,-434.9330000000001
 Elinor was soon called to the card table by the conclusion of the first rubber and the confidential discourse of the two ladies was therefore at an end to which both of them submitted without any reluctance for nothing had been said on either side to make them dislike each other less than they had done before and Elinor sat down to the card table with the melancholy persuasion that Edward was not only without affection for the person who was to be his wife but that he had not even the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage which sincere affection on HER side would have given for self interest alone could induce a woman to keep a man to an engagement of which she seemed so thoroughly aware that he was weary,-1596.1920000000007
 He continued at the window and after calmly and politely saying I hope the little boy is better was silent,-247.11599999999996
 Many a time has she said so and yet I am no advocate for entire seclusion,-201.302
 Weston,-19.179000000000002
 HER wisdom too limited the number of their servants to three two maids and a man with whom they were speedily provided from amongst those who had formed their establishment at Norland,-404.3830000000001
 Miss Dashwood a subject such as this untouched for fourteen years it is dangerous to handle it at all,-234.10799999999995
 He has been here this very morning on a most extraordinary errand,-141.605
 On the contrary her plans and proceedings were more and more justified and endeared to her by the general appearances of the next few days,-304.502
 She had no doubt of what Mr Weston was often thinking about,-132.675
 It had formerly been Charlotte s and over the mantelpiece still hung a landscape in coloured silks of her performance in proof of her having spent seven years at a great school in town to some effect,-453.17199999999997
 Elinor advised her to lie down again and for a moment she did so but no attitude could give her ease and in restless pain of mind and body she moved from one posture to another till growing more and more hysterical her sister could with difficulty keep her on the bed at all and for some time was fearful of being constrained to call for assistance,-805.205
 Elinor could hardly believe this to be true as it seemed very unlikely that Willoughby should propose or Marianne consent to enter the house while Mrs Smith was in it with whom Marianne had not the smallest acquaintance,-463.40299999999985
 I shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn instead of coming here,-208.51499999999996
 This she had been prepared for when she entered the house but meant having once talked him handsomely over to be no farther incommoded by any troublesome topic and to wander at large amongst all the Mistresses and Misses of Highbury and their card parties,-533.0490000000002
 There was no denying that those brothers had penetration,-108.31600000000002
 I have not seen him since seven o clock,-96.938
 Maple Grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be for we do not at all affect to equal my brother Mr Suckling in income However my resolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax I shall certainly have her very often at my house shall introduce her wherever I can shall have musical parties to draw out her talents and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation,-911.6690000000004
 Without that attraction not all her money would have tempted Elliot and Sir Walter was moreover assured of her having been a very fine woman,-305.585
 I have no thoughts of matrimony at present,-86.44300000000001
 He is thought to be gouty,-67.571
 cried Emma at that rate what will become of her,-123.057
 The same manners however which recommended Mrs John Dashwood to the good opinion of Lady Middleton did not suit the fancy of Mrs Jennings and to HER she appeared nothing more than a little proud looking woman of uncordial address who met her husband s sisters without any affection and almost without having anything to say to them for of the quarter of an hour bestowed on Berkeley Street she sat at least seven minutes and a half in silence,-960.362
 It may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred or even fifty pounds from our own expenses,-235.68899999999996
 In a very few weeks from the day which brought Sir John Middleton s first letter to Norland every thing was so far settled in their future abode as to enable Mrs Dashwood and her daughters to begin their journey,-488.47
 She thought well of Frank in almost every respect and what was more she loved him very much and her defence was therefore earnest,-295.471
 Time however she thought would tell him that they ought to be friends again,-176.33899999999997
 To give up one s child,-78.94500000000001
 It was a very awkward moment and the countenance of each shewed that it was so,-170.83999999999997
 The secrecy with which everything had been carried on between them was rationally treated as enormously heightening the crime because had any suspicion of it occurred to the others proper measures would have been taken to prevent the marriage and he called on Elinor to join with him in regretting that Lucy s engagement with Edward had not rather been fulfilled than that she should thus be the means of spreading misery farther in the family He thus continued,-966.2850000000002
 Elinor was grateful for the attention but it could not alter her design and their mother s concurrence being readily gained every thing relative to their return was arranged as far as it could be and Marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement of the hours that were yet to divide her from Barton,-671.6010000000001
 I might have sold it again the next day for more than I gave but with regard to the purchase money I might have been very unfortunate indeed for the stocks were at that time so low that if I had not happened to have the necessary sum in my banker s hands I must have sold out to very great loss,-720.3070000000004
 She would not take a denial,-70.259
 I hope my dear Miss Dashwood will excuse the liberty I take of writing to her but I know your friendship for me will make you pleased to hear such a good account of myself and my dear Edward after all the troubles we have went through lately therefore will make no more apologies but proceed to say that thank God,-731.8030000000003
 But you are always kind,-62.451
 Hear the truth therefore now while you are unprejudiced,-114.30199999999999
 why cannot I speak to him,-78.994
 so long ago as the 7th of November as I am going to read to you and has never been well since,-262.652
 They walked I conclude,-52.721999999999994
 It will give you every thing that you want consideration independence a proper home it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends close to Hartfield and to me and confirm our intimacy for ever,-453.5630000000001
 What Elinor said in reply she could not distinguish but judged from the motion of her lips that she did not think THAT any material objection and Mrs Jennings commended her in her heart for being so honest,-454.35900000000015
 Every body is so surprized and every body says the same obliging things,-161.98499999999999
 Miss Dashwood had a delicate complexion regular features and a remarkably pretty figure,-169.03699999999998
 Elinor scolded him harshly as ladies always scold the imprudence which compliments themselves for having spent so much time with them at Norland when he must have felt his own inconstancy,-389.255
 It first came into my head replied Mrs Smith upon finding how much you were together and feeling it to be the most probable thing in the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you and you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you in the same way,-656.2740000000002
 Every body pretends to feel and tries to describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what picturesque beauty was,-291.004
 You were speaking said he gravely,-77.207
 Anne understood it,-42.842
 She was their earliest visitor in their settled life and Captain Wentworth by putting her in the way of recovering her husband s property in the West Indies by writing for her acting for her and seeing her through all the petty difficulties of the case with the activity and exertion of a fearless man and a determined friend fully requited the services which she had rendered or ever meant to render to his wife,-895.1260000000003
 The hair was curled and the maid sent away and Emma sat down to think and be miserable It was a wretched business indeed Such an overthrow of every thing she had been wishing for Such a development of every thing most unwelcome Such a blow for Harriet that was the worst of all,-634.5020000000002
 His marriage must still be a distant good at least I am afraid it cannot take place very soon,-232.49599999999995
 To confess the truth said Mrs Smith assuming her usual air of cheerfulness that is exactly the pleasure I want you to have,-286.18
 do the children grow,-61.275
 and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurred to me this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the Campbells may it not be from Mr Knightley,-521.713
 I have not been working uninterruptedly he replied I have been assisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily it was not quite firm an unevenness in the floor I believe,-388.7960000000001
 Books of engravings drawers of medals cameos corals shells and every other family collection within his cabinets had been prepared for his old friend to while away the morning and the kindness had perfectly answered,-405.775
 I am disappointed was his only answer,-80.835
 a word to the wise I am in a fine flow of spirits an t I,-203.23399999999995
 No,-15.143
 Marianne was restored to her from a danger in which as she now began to feel her own mistaken judgment in encouraging the unfortunate attachment to Willoughby had contributed to place her and in her recovery she had yet another source of joy unthought of by Elinor,-582.4090000000001
 Her unwillingness to quit her mother was her only restorative to calmness and at the moment of parting her grief on that score was excessive,-308.6430000000001
 Yes Frank came over this morning just to ask us how we did,-169.339
 He imagined and calmly could he imagine it that her extravagance and consequent distress had obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief,-312.30299999999994
 Undoubtedly if they had known your engagement said she nothing could be more flattering than their treatment of you but as that was not the case,-318.45699999999994
 It was a dislike so little just every imputed fault was so magnified by fancy that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any considerable absence without feeling that she had injured her and now when the due visit was paid on her arrival after a two years interval she was particularly struck with the very appearance and manners which for those two whole years she had been depreciating,-850.1870000000005
 She was on the point of sending again for Mr Harris or if HE could not come for some other advice when the former but not till after five o clock arrived,-388.83299999999997
 Use those words again and I will leave the room this moment,-146.762
 He is as good a sort of fellow I believe as ever lived repeated Sir John,-185.65699999999998
 For shame,-30.829
 He was wishing to get the better of his attachment to herself she just recovering from her mania for Mr Elton,-241.35299999999998
 Perfectly remember Mrs Perry s coming Extraordinary dream indeed,-117.56800000000001
 I think Emma I shall try and persuade her to stay longer with us,-162.947
 Whatever the truth of it might be and far as Elinor was from feeling thorough contentment about it yet while she saw Marianne in spirits she could not be very uncomfortable herself,-386.28
 Walk home you are prettily shod for walking home I dare say,-147.43000000000004
 He was not hungry it would only make him hotter,-114.842
 when a gallant young man like Mr Frank Churchill said Mr Knightley dryly writes to a fair lady like Miss Woodhouse he will of course put forth his best,-361.103
 Yes Jane says she is sure they will but yet this is such a situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining,-282.06899999999996
 She could not speak another word Her voice was lost and she sat down waiting in great terror till Harriet should answer,-262.03999999999996
 Elinor then heard Willoughby say in a low voice to Marianne There are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure,-269.195
 The agony of grief which overpowered them at first was voluntarily renewed was sought for was created again and again,-250.48899999999995
 They had not been long seated and composed when Mr Woodhouse with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh called his daughter s attention to the sad change at Hartfield since she had been there last,-442.1300000000001
 The most unaccountable business,-52.172999999999995
 This however was a profound secret not to be breathed beyond their own circle,-166.841
 What is all this,-50.787000000000006
 The remaining five were now to draw their cards,-114.447
 But it would have been more like Willoughby to acknowledge them at once,-142.94400000000002
 No doubt it had been from jealousy In Jane s eyes she had been a rival and well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed,-360.285
 She was just as determined when the morrow came and went early that nothing might prevent her,-208.487
 This had been a proof of life however of service to her sister and Henrietta though perfectly incapable of being in the same room with Louisa was kept by the agitation of hope and fear from a return of her own insensibility,-493.32800000000003
 Elinor could not find herself in the carriage with Mrs Jennings and beginning a journey to London under her protection and as her guest without wondering at her own situation so short had their acquaintance with that lady been so wholly unsuited were they in age and disposition and so many had been her objections against such a measure only a few days before,-769.6480000000003
 And as to the house being a bad one I do not know what the Colonel would be at for it is as good a one as ever I saw,-331.75900000000007
 Wherever they went she was evidently always on the watch,-125.79299999999999
 They will be delighted to come to morrow evening,-107.283
 I have heard so much in praise of Mr Frank Churchill At the same time it is fair to observe that I am one of those who always judge for themselves and are by no means implicitly guided by others,-452.596
 The doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other,-134.60700000000003
 It was a long well written letter giving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings expressing all the affection gratitude and respect which was natural and honourable and describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed attractive with spirit and precision,-538.5790000000002
 The horror of being blocked up at Randalls while her children were at Hartfield was full in her imagination and fancying the road to be now just passable for adventurous people but in a state that admitted no delay she was eager to have it settled that her father and Emma should remain at Randalls while she and her husband set forward instantly through all the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them,-909.8630000000003
 Well I was persuaded there were two,-89.352
 Yes and he was up again at eight to ride to covert,-148.74800000000005
 Let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations,-119.93700000000003
 he talks of you cried Charles in such terms Mary interrupted him,-159.123
 No more it is,-49.934
 and in some points there seems a hardness of heart about him,-149.70999999999998
 Undoubtedly if you wish it I will endeavour to persuade them both,-152.321
 There was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse on another subject,-155.315
 She could not endure its noise,-64.7
 Perhaps I may sometimes have felt that Harriet would not forget what was due or rather what would be kind by me,-276.324
 Mr Perry did say so,-63.87799999999999
 She questioned him as to the society in Yorkshire the extent of the neighbourhood about Enscombe and the sort and could make out from his answers that as far as Enscombe was concerned there was very little going on that their visitings were among a range of great families none very near and that even when days were fixed and invitations accepted it was an even chance that Mrs Churchill were not in health and spirits for going that they made a point of visiting no fresh person and that though he had his separate engagements it was not without difficulty without considerable address at times that he could get away or introduce an acquaintance for a night,-1437.7920000000001
 Richard Oh,-36.959
 Can it be woman,-57.105
 One meeting was unavoidable,-57.576
 It had not been necessary and the few occasions of its being possible for her to go to the Hall she had contrived to evade and escape from,-321.42800000000005
 We do so wish that Charles had married Anne instead,-130.249
 A continuance in a place where everything reminded her of former delight was exactly what suited her mind,-228.499
 And when I think of Benwick my tongue is tied,-124.33900000000003
 CHAPTER 32,-22.075000000000003
 And cannot you call me George now,-93.06600000000002
 I do not suppose the situation my friend Mrs Rooke is in at present will furnish much either to interest or edify me,-273.19199999999995
 Her father and Harriet,-50.919
 Your father might have asked us to dinner I think if he had wanted to see us,-206.76000000000002
 He began by speaking of the concert gravely more like the Captain Wentworth of Uppercross owned himself disappointed had expected singing and in short must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over,-426.98900000000003
 No indeed I am not,-56.129
 This was too much,-42.896
 You may depend upon it that they will move in the first set in Bath this winter and as rank is rank your being known to be related to them will have its use in fixing your family our family let me say in that degree of consideration which we must all wish for,-663.2080000000001
 If Miss Taylor undertakes to wrap Miss Emma up you need not have any fears sir,-200.74900000000002
 The other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax and there she had no doubt,-189.332
 Thirteen years had seen her mistress of Kellynch Hall presiding and directing with a self possession and decision which could never have given the idea of her being younger than she was,-385.10999999999984
 His father would not own himself uneasy and laughed at her fears but she could not be cured of wishing that he would part with his black mare,-334.86999999999995
 Elinor who had now been for some time reflecting on the propriety or impropriety of speedily hazarding her narration without feeling at all nearer decision than at first heard this and perceiving that as reflection did nothing resolution must do all soon found herself leading to the fact,-597.0880000000001
 Their sisters and Mrs Jennings were invited likewise and John Dashwood was careful to secure Colonel Brandon who always glad to be where the Miss Dashwoods were received his eager civilities with some surprise but much more pleasure,-464.03900000000016
 On one side was a table occupied by some chattering girls cutting up silk and gold paper and on the other were tressels and trays bending under the weight of brawn and cold pies where riotous boys were holding high revel the whole completed by a roaring Christmas fire which seemed determined to be heard in spite of all the noise of the others,-756.2060000000004
 I know we agreed never to name him but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else I should not have thought it possible that I could be supposed to mean any other person,-406.72200000000004
 I am every instant hearing something which overpowers me,-105.728
 This is saying very plainly Pray Miss Smith give me leave to pay my addresses to you,-208.69399999999996
 She consulted and in a degree was influenced by her in marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted to Sir Walter,-301.46
 She was obliged to recollect that her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour that no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies that no private correspondence could bear the eye of others before she could recover calmness enough to return the letter which she had been meditating over and say,-681.8460000000001
 Well said Mrs Weston smiling you give him credit for more simple disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do for while Miss Bates was speaking a suspicion darted into my head and I have never been able to get it out again,-504.28600000000006
 there were very different thoughts to succeed,-98.239
 You will not ask me what is the point of envy You are determined I see to have no curiosity You are wise but I cannot be wise,-333.242
 They were three days on their journey and Marianne s behaviour as they travelled was a happy specimen of what future complaisance and companionableness to Mrs Jennings might be expected to be,-378.06399999999996
 When the ladies withdrew to the drawing room after dinner this poverty was particularly evident for the gentlemen HAD supplied the discourse with some variety the variety of politics inclosing land and breaking horses but then it was all over and one subject only engaged the ladies till coffee came in which was the comparative heights of Harry Dashwood and Lady Middleton s second son William who were nearly of the same age,-891.6950000000004
 Mary M,-33.571
 Henrietta was exactly in that state of recently improved views of fresh formed happiness which made her full of regard and interest for everybody she had ever liked before at all and Mrs Musgrove s real affection had been won by her usefulness when they were in distress,-590.4900000000004
 She begged him to think again on the subject,-103.23200000000001
 Mrs John Dashwood wished it likewise but in the mean while till one of these superior blessings could be attained it would have quieted her ambition to see him driving a barouche,-385.2710000000001
 He rode down for a couple of hours he could not yet do more but as he came from Randalls immediately to Hartfield she could then exercise all her quick observation and speedily determine how he was influenced and how she must act,-528.8210000000001
 His profession qualified him his disposition lead him to talk and That was in the year six That happened before I went to sea in the year six occurred in the course of the first evening they spent together and though his voice did not falter and though she had no reason to suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke Anne felt the utter impossibility from her knowledge of his mind that he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself,-991.483
 While they were at breakfast the letters were brought in,-125.94099999999999
 Her spring of felicity was in the glow of her spirits as her friend Anne s was in the warmth of her heart,-274.86099999999993
 You are speaking of letters of business mine are letters of friendship,-149.145
 Elton is a very good sort of man and a very respectable vicar of Highbury but not at all likely to make an imprudent match,-284.982
 That his repentance of misconduct which thus brought its own punishment was sincere need not be doubted nor that he long thought of Colonel Brandon with envy and of Marianne with regret,-400.09700000000004
 They went in and while the sleek well tied parcels of Men s Beavers and York Tan were bringing down and displaying on the counter he said But I beg your pardon Miss Woodhouse you were speaking to me you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my amor patriae,-646.7500000000002
 I was the last man who commanded her,-92.43900000000001
 Depend upon it whatever esteem Mr Elliot may have for his own situation in life now as a young man he had not the smallest value for it,-329.19499999999994
 said Mrs Jennings that is HER revenge,-86.85300000000001
 To me it would seem only a commercial exchange in which each wished to be benefited at the expense of the other,-263.05499999999995
 I do not understand what you mean by success said Mr Knightley,-125.68900000000002
 Excuse me Miss Dashwood,-53.69499999999999
 It is very right that you SHOULD go to town I would have every young woman of your condition in life acquainted with the manners and amusements of London,-352.56199999999995
 I can satisfy you perhaps on points which you would little expect and as to his marriage I knew all about it at the time,-290.73599999999993
 But what can be the matter Is she really not ill,-134.54200000000003
 Were she your equal in situation but Emma consider how far this is from being the case,-217.14300000000003
 As for regret said Marianne I have done with that as far as HE is concerned,-188.87999999999997
 This charade If I had studied a twelvemonth I could never have made any thing like it,-204.417
 He hesitated got up walked to a window,-103.684
 That neither Harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our mutual attachment,-167.719
 For the world would not she have seemed to threaten me Imagine the shock imagine how till I had actually detected my own blunder I raved at the blunders of the post What was to be done One thing only I must speak to my uncle,-556.317
 There is no necessity for my calling this morning said the young man another day would do as well but there was that degree of acquaintance at Weymouth which,-344.96900000000005
 Their party was small and the hours passed quietly away,-130.692
 Not I indeed,-45.037
 You had better explore to Donwell replied Mr Knightley,-106.67600000000002
 He trifles here said he as to the temptation,-106.013
 My idea of good company Mr Elliot is the company of clever well informed people who have a great deal of conversation that is what I call good company,-341.44200000000006
 All that remained to be wished was that the nephew should form the attachment as with all her goodwill in the cause Emma could feel no certainty of its being already formed,-393.991
 have you met him to,-73.95400000000001
 Yes continued Elinor gathering more resolution as some of the worst was over Colonel Brandon means it as a testimony of his concern for what has lately passed for the cruel situation in which the unjustifiable conduct of your family has placed you a concern which I am sure Marianne myself and all your friends must share and likewise as a proof of his high esteem for your general character and his particular approbation of your behaviour on the present occasion,-991.017
 Quite a surprize to me,-66.57499999999999
 I thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased but it is now a confirmed feeling,-190.911
 On this point Sir John could give more certain intelligence and he told them that Mr Willoughby had no property of his own in the country that he resided there only while he was visiting the old lady at Allenham Court to whom he was related and whose possessions he was to inherit adding Yes yes he is very well worth catching I can tell you Miss Dashwood he has a pretty little estate of his own in Somersetshire besides and if I were you I would not give him up to my younger sister in spite of all this tumbling down hills,-1230.7650000000003
 Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could with thorough self approbation recommend though he might constrain himself while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things to say,-439.62200000000007
 We really are so shocked,-68.986
 With their wealth their views increased their want of a larger house their inclination for more company,-219.70999999999998
 Yes he was not married when I knew him first,-123.67200000000001
 But this conciliation was not granted for though she often threw out expressions of pity for her sister to Elinor and more than once dropt a reflection on the inconstancy of beaux before Marianne no effect was produced but a look of indifference from the former or of disgust in the latter,-632.1910000000003
 You are mistaken Elinor you are very much mistaken,-102.209
 A man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one whose father his father might have disdained to speak to and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself than in any other line,-506.8060000000001
 Her gestures and movements might be understood by any one who looked on like Emma but her words every body s words were soon lost under the incessant flow of Miss Bates who came in talking and had not finished her speech under many minutes after her being admitted into the circle at the fire,-680.0820000000002
 The Coles expressed themselves so properly there was so much real attention in the manner of it so much consideration for her father,-276.33899999999994
 What was I talking of,-66.33399999999999
 Nothing can be actually settled yet perhaps replied Emma smiling but excuse me it must be thought of,-218.578
 Frank Churchill had danced once at Highbury and longed to dance again and the last half hour of an evening which Mr Woodhouse was persuaded to spend with his daughter at Randalls was passed by the two young people in schemes on the subject,-522.1869999999999
 After one of the many praises of the day which were continually bursting forth Captain Wentworth added,-210.61499999999998
 CHAPTER 37,-22.075000000000003
 The young ladies went and Lady Middleton was happily preserved from the frightful solitude which had threatened her,-220.62199999999999
 I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him,-138.91000000000003
 Thank you thank you my own sweet little friend,-115.27100000000002
 The aunt was a capricious woman and governed her husband entirely but it was not in Mr Weston s nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear and as he believed so deservedly dear,-489.57800000000015
 It depends entirely upon his aunt s spirits and pleasure in short upon her temper,-193.43699999999998
 I am quite of your opinion Mrs Croft was Mrs Musgrove s hearty answer,-158.36999999999998
 My dear Miss Woodhouse a vast deal may be done by those who dare to act,-188.863
 She assured him that she had not,-75.74600000000001
 Two thousand a year without debt or drawback except the little love child indeed aye I had forgot her but she may be prenticed out at a small cost and then what does it signify,-438.469
 A very fine young man indeed Mr Weston,-91.80900000000001
 He is only a commander it is true made last summer and these are bad times for getting on but he has not another fault that I know of,-349.74199999999996
 She will break it to you better than I can,-116.214
 It will be natural for me he added shortly afterwards to speak my opinion aloud as I read,-221.59
 The card table was then placed and Elinor began to wonder at herself for having ever entertained a hope of finding time for conversation at the park,-330.55899999999997
 very little Nothing that I regard,-84.458
 Infirmity,-13.251999999999999
 I am monstrous glad of it,-57.367
 I have engaged Mrs Weston to correspond with me,-100.617
 Elinor Elinor they who suffer little may be proud and independent as they like may resist insult or return mortification but I cannot,-292.13599999999997
 What answer did you give him Did you allow him to hope,-154.21
 In the present instance it was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit and after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice she quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene as made her say to Harriet as they walked away,-588.0740000000001
 The weather added what it could of gloom,-100.99400000000001
 What a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other,-138.867
 and yet she could not help rather anticipating something decisive,-119.70400000000002
 Marianne s was finished in a very few minutes in length it could be no more than a note it was then folded up sealed and directed with eager rapidity,-353.5170000000001
 At that moment she first perceived him and her whole countenance glowing with sudden delight she would have moved towards him instantly had not her sister caught hold of her,-371.692
 When he was again in their company he could not help remembering what he had seen nor could he avoid observations which unless it were like Cowper and his fire at twilight,-386.72900000000004
 They all looked exceedingly foolish and Edward seemed to have as great an inclination to walk out of the room again as to advance farther into it,-322.96299999999997
 But colds were never so prevalent as they have been this autumn,-149.188
 That will never be however I can assure you,-108.543
 I have to thank you Miss Woodhouse for a very kind forgiving message in one of Mrs Weston s letters,-225.40399999999994
 His demands and your inexperience together on a small very small income must have brought on distresses which would not be the LESS grievous to you from having been entirely unknown and unthought of before,-429.95300000000003
 Mr Weston was chatty and convivial and no friend to early separations of any sort but at last the drawing room party did receive an augmentation,-300.341
 She could do little more than listen patiently soften every grievance and excuse each to the other give them all hints of the forbearance necessary between such near neighbours and make those hints broadest which were meant for her sister s benefit,-510.4330000000002
 Mr Churchill oh,-40.082
 Anne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion answers to urgent applications from Mrs Smith which all breathed the same stern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble and under a cold civility the same hard hearted indifference to any of the evils it might bring on her,-624.3970000000003
 They could go there again with them in the autumn,-123.26499999999997
 Harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at Mrs Goddard s Mr Elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great girls in the school and it must be at Hartfield only that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or repellent truth,-613.2550000000001
 You can send for us you know at a moment s notice if anything is the matter but I dare say there will be nothing to alarm you,-329.064
 How I catch myself out,-66.752
 my dear Fanny her life cannot be worth half that purchase,-143.078
 Anne did not share these feelings,-77.224
 You will have no business here Let it stay however said she give it houseroom till Colonel Campbell comes back,-247.196
 But upon my word Mr Elton in your case I should certainly excuse myself,-169.32099999999997
 The treachery or the folly of my cousin s maid betrayed us,-151.10799999999998
 I wish as well as every body else to be perfectly happy but like every body else it must be in my own way,-268.04299999999995
 Don t let them make YOU unhappy,-92.41700000000002
 Emma knows I never flatter her said Mr Knightley but I meant no reflection on any body,-206.445
 You can t think how much I go through in my mind from it altogether,-182.38099999999997
 She was of course the object of their joint dislike When they had nothing else to say it must be always easy to begin abusing Miss Woodhouse and the enmity which they dared not shew in open disrespect to her found a broader vent in contemptuous treatment of Harriet,-577.0210000000002
 Your sister s marriage,-52.19
 Her situation should secure your compassion,-80.25
 A fortnight,-30.546
 If he would only have done as well by himself said John Dashwood as all his friends were disposed to do by him he might now have been in his proper situation and would have wanted for nothing,-466.948
 Do let me hear a word about the expense of it,-134.18099999999998
 with a heart pierced wounded almost broken,-94.56900000000002
 has he written to you,-70.194
 Yes I left London this morning at eight o clock and the only ten minutes I have spent out of my chaise since that time procured me a nuncheon at Marlborough,-379.14000000000004
 But I think my dear you said you had got it,-130.273
 The advantage of his having to come only to Uppercross instead of going six miles another way of his having in every respect a better curacy of his belonging to their dear Dr Shirley and of dear good Dr Shirley s being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through without most injurious fatigue had been a great deal even to Louisa but had been almost everything to Henrietta,-876.2830000000004
 Lucky fellow to get anything so soon with no more interest than his,-164.62900000000002
 Oh did not you,-51.805
 He told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining room hated sitting long was always the first to move when he could that his father Mr Knightley Mr Cox and Mr Cole were left very busy over parish business that as long as he had staid however it had been pleasant enough as he had found them in general a set of gentlemanlike sensible men and spoke so handsomely of Highbury altogether thought it so abundant in agreeable families that Emma began to feel she had been used to despise the place rather too much,-1157.754
 Elton before she could be spoken to was ready and before Mr Woodhouse had reached her with his request to be allowed to hand her into the dining parlour was saying,-376.08900000000006
 When I see him again said Elinor to herself as the door shut him out I shall see him the husband of Lucy,-282.71099999999996
 A situation such as you deserve and your friends would require for you is no everyday occurrence is not obtained at a moment s notice indeed indeed we must begin inquiring directly,-402.22800000000007
 And now silently conjectured Elinor she will write to Combe by this day s post,-186.61499999999998
 She was as happy as possible with the Martins in the summer,-136.108
 My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings Lords of the earth,-143.204
 So very obliging of you No rain at all,-108.24300000000002
 she shall not do such a thing again eagerly rejoined Mrs Elton,-145.48000000000002
 By reading only six hours a day I shall gain in the course of a twelve month a great deal of instruction which I now feel myself to want,-351.05100000000004
 A speedy cure must not be hoped but everything was going on as well as the nature of the case admitted,-244.37800000000001
 He stopped,-25.416
 How mortifying to feel that it was so,-90.575
 His air and voice recovered their usual briskness he shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand and entered on the subject in a manner to prove that he now only wanted time and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing,-531.1340000000001
 my love I could not then talk of hope to him or to myself,-174.40699999999998
 Her mutterings were chiefly to her husband and he murmured in reply,-147.201
 Not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to recommend the other but from the very first and she was not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration but without solicitation or plea or privilege she must be wanting to assist and befriend her Before Emma had forfeited her confidence and about the third time of their meeting she heard all Mrs Elton s knight errantry on the subject,-908.9829999999997
 That there was to be such a party had been long generally known it had even given the idea of another,-252.49199999999996
 He looked around as if to see that no one were near and then said,-181.61299999999997
 The absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then an immediate struggle but after a while she could do no more,-253.94899999999998
 His letters disgust me,-56.337999999999994
 I believe I was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper,-166.428
 Poor Harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that Emma could give,-294.98
 Walter cried Charles Hayter why do you not do as you are bid,-167.469
 The impertinence of the Eltons which for a few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening had been the occasion of some of its highest satisfactions and she looked forward to another happy result the cure of Harriet s infatuation From Harriet s manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted the ballroom she had strong hopes,-719.424
 I meant said Elinor taking up some work from the table to inquire for Mrs EDWARD Ferrars,-213.041
 Emma was quite at a loss,-66.348
 The weather was not tempting enough to draw the two others from their pencil and their book in spite of Marianne s declaration that the day would be lastingly fair and that every threatening cloud would be drawn off from their hills and the two girls set off together,-595.8190000000002
 Yes sighed Anne we shall indeed be known to be related to them,-163.356
 Good company requires only birth education and manners and with regard to education is not very nice,-216.46299999999997
 I should scold her myself if she were capable of wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new friend,-266.0439999999999
 Charles you had much better go back and change the box for Tuesday,-169.93499999999997
 Certainly said Elinor he seems very agreeable,-93.134
 But I assure you I have never been in the house above twice in my life,-164.755
 It will be so ridiculous to see all his letters directed to him with an M P But do you know he says he will never frank for me,-348.923
 An hour s complete leisure for such reflections as these on a dark November day a small thick rain almost blotting out the very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows was enough to make the sound of Lady Russell s carriage exceedingly welcome and yet though desirous to be gone she could not quit the Mansion House or look an adieu to the Cottage with its black dripping and comfortless veranda or even notice through the misty glasses the last humble tenements of the village without a saddened heart,-1113.0090000000007
 Yes dear ma am said Mrs Croft or an uncertain engagement an engagement which may be long,-212.243
 But I must object to your dooming Colonel Brandon and his wife to the constant confinement of a sick chamber merely because he chanced to complain yesterday a very cold damp day of a slight rheumatic feel in one of his shoulders,-511.8560000000001
 Fortune I do not want employment I do not want consequence I do not want I believe few married women are half as much mistress of their husband s house as I am of Hartfield and never never could I expect to be so truly beloved and important so always first and always right in any man s eyes as I am in my father s,-778.412
 The unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by Elizabeth Martin s calling at Mrs Goddard s a few days afterwards,-335.777
 Do not we rather surpass your expectations,-88.929
 They can do nothing satisfactorily without you,-93.27000000000001
 Very well I shall not attempt to deny Emma s being pretty,-140.592
 She began to think that be must be in liquor the strangeness of such a visit and of such manners seemed no otherwise intelligible and with this impression she immediately rose saying,-371.94900000000007
 yes but how they were conveyed hither the manner of their coming,-158.32800000000003
 She would not speak to Anne with half the certainty she felt on the subject she would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter of a possible attachment on his side of the desirableness of the alliance supposing such attachment to be real and returned,-572.181
 In feeling in action in condition in every thing,-112.36600000000001
 I love to look at her and I will add this praise that I do not think her personally vain,-221.334
 There is no danger of your not being intelligible which is the first thing,-166.36200000000002
 If a woman can ever be excused for thinking only of herself it is in a situation like Jane Fairfax s Of such one may almost say that the world is not their s nor the world s law,-477.3750000000002
 The following spring he was seen again in town found equally agreeable again encouraged invited and expected and again he did not come and the next tidings were that he was married,-386.2420000000001
 The delightful family party which Emma was securing for herself poor Harriet must in mere charitable caution be kept at a distance from,-285.12699999999995
 Their intended excursion to Whitwell turned out very different from what Elinor had expected,-178.649
 But have I ever known it Well may it be doubted for had I really loved could I have sacrificed my feelings to vanity to avarice or what is more could I have sacrificed hers But I have done it,-492.7700000000001
 His perception of the striking improvement of Harriet s manner since her introduction at Hartfield was not one of the least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment,-331.461
 She was sure of a pleasant reception and her friend seemed this morning particularly obliged to her for coming seemed hardly to have expected her though it had been an appointment,-361.15599999999995
 Did Mrs Ferrars look well,-70.03
 How absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval had banished into distance and indistinctness,-215.95699999999997
 Mrs Charles quite swears by her I know but I just give you this hint that you may be upon the watch because if you see anything amiss you need not be afraid of mentioning it,-428.15400000000017
 A little curiosity Emma had and she made the most of it while her friend related,-202.45399999999995
 It seemed at first an accidental division but it never materially varied,-150.903
 Full many a flower is born to blush unseen And waste its fragrance on the desert air,-217.28699999999998
 Are you going near Camden Place,-77.606
 Emma felt they were friends again and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction and then a little sauciness she could not help saying as he was admiring the baby,-370.82700000000006
 Very well,-27.857999999999997
 which my mother being on the watch heard distinctly and was sadly alarmed at,-185.30899999999997
 I had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to the fashion and strength of any old pelisse which you had seen lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember and which at last on some very wet day is lent to yourself,-595.8020000000004
 It now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be done as to their general situation,-242.73699999999994
 She is not the superior young woman which Emma s friend ought to be,-156.864
 She knew that at times she must be missed and could not think without pain of Emma s losing a single pleasure or suffering an hour s ennui from the want of her companionableness but dear Emma was of no feeble character she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have been and had sense and energy and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations,-934.6110000000002
 it shews what a sad invalid I am,-108.26100000000001
 And had you a great many smart beaux there,-111.51600000000002
 James could take the note,-73.923
 He answered rather hesitatingly Yes I believe I do very much recovered but she is altered there is no running or jumping about no laughing or dancing it is quite different,-380.63300000000015
 These were her reasons she had no better,-101.04199999999999
 No I fancy not replied Mrs Elton with a most satisfied smile,-150.07
 As soon as Mrs Dashwood had recovered herself to see Marianne was her first desire and in two minutes she was with her beloved child rendered dearer to her than ever by absence unhappiness and danger,-440.8470000000001
 Why do you not ask Marianne at once said she whether she is or she is not engaged to Willoughby,-254.034
 Absolute neglect of the mother and sisters when invited to come would be ingratitude,-179.16699999999997
 He saw a short word prepared for Emma and given to her with a look sly and demure,-217.46099999999998
 To me who live so much alone her conversation I assure you is a treat,-187.334
 No not at Randalls I have not been near Randalls when the door was thrown open and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked into the room,-295.78999999999996
 Miss Bates looked about her so happily,-91.376
 I wonder who the friend was and who could be the young lady,-154.45499999999998
 Indeed you wrong me replied Lucy with great solemnity I know nobody of whose judgment I think so highly as I do of yours and I do really believe that if you was to say to me I advise you by all means to put an end to your engagement with Edward Ferrars it will be more for the happiness of both of you I should resolve upon doing it immediately,-851.047
 The clock struck twelve as she passed through the hall,-122.565
 Not a puncture not a weak spot anywhere,-103.35500000000002
 It is Frank and Miss Fairfax said Mrs Weston,-98.13800000000002
 This was really his said Harriet Do not you remember one morning no I dare say you do not,-219.327
 I was breakfasting at the Ellisons and her letter with some others was brought to me there from my lodgings,-233.41399999999996
 Ay my dear I ll warrant you we do,-117.28200000000002
 And it was spoken with a sort of sighing animation which had a vast deal of the lover,-206.805
 Mrs Churchill was unwell far too unwell to do without him she had been in a very suffering state so said her husband when writing to her nephew two days before though from her usual unwillingness to give pain and constant habit of never thinking of herself she had not mentioned it but now she was too ill to trifle and must entreat him to set off for Enscombe without delay,-854.0570000000002
 I could not answer it,-54.968999999999994
 Does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a second attachment,-173.883
 He had handed them both in and placed himself between them and in this manner under these circumstances full of astonishment and emotion to Anne she quitted Lyme,-340.20200000000006
 She was not doomed however to be long in ignorance of his measures,-149.954
 How could she have been so brutal so cruel to Miss Bates,-139.212
 In that he could not be defended but if he had injured her how much more had he injured himself if her case were pitiable his was hopeless,-327.3140000000001
 I will leave you said Elinor if you will go to bed,-137.376
 They would hardly come in their chaise I think at that season of the year,-184.163
 He was very unkind to his first wife,-94.71
 I told you that your suspicions would guide mine,-106.79700000000001
 Sir John who called on them more than once brought home such accounts of the favour they were in as must be universally striking,-295.403
 What Miss Anne says is very true was Mr Shepherd s rejoinder and Oh,-176.316
 She thinks so little of her own beauty,-94.20700000000001
 Well I believe if you will excuse me Mr Knightley if you will not consider me as doing a very rude thing I shall take Emma s advice and go out for a quarter of an hour,-438.3200000000001
 The answer was Oh no never she has quite given up dancing,-152.827
 You who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on these subjects who must have been so deep in the business on Miss Campbell s account we shall not excuse your being indifferent about Mr Elton and Miss Hawkins,-488.26300000000003
 I am quite ready,-40.135999999999996
 She surprised Elinor very much as they returned into the drawing room by asking her whether she did not like Mr Palmer excessively,-269.253
 Sorrow came a gentle sorrow but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness Miss Taylor married,-230.40699999999995
 I have known it these four months,-79.782
 She must wait a moment or he would think her mad,-133.986
 Perhaps she might but it is not every man s fate to marry the woman who loves him best,-233.09899999999996
 Though she did not feel the first intelligence as she might have done the day before or an hour before its interest soon increased and before their first conversation was over she had talked herself into all the sensations of curiosity wonder and regret pain and pleasure as to this fortunate Miss Hawkins which could conduce to place the Martins under proper subordination in her fancy,-811.261
 the best nature in the world a wedding,-103.037
 Marianne s lips quivered and she repeated the word Selfish,-126.964
 but dear Miss Woodhouse she is now in such retirement such obscurity so thrown away Whatever advantages she may have enjoyed with the Campbells are so palpably at an end,-374.694
 When I got to Donwell said he Knightley could not be found,-145.78400000000002
 That is I know you must have seen her a hundred times but are you acquainted,-188.08299999999997
 Mr Elton certainly did not very well know what to say,-123.48400000000001
 She was quite easy on that head and consequently full of strength and courage till for a moment electrified by Mrs Croft s suddenly saying,-298.76
 The old walnut trees are all come down to make room for it,-161.73000000000002
 He has those to please who must be pleased and who between ourselves are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices,-295.812
 A little beauty and a few smiles and a few compliments to the navy and I am a lost man,-240.78599999999994
 Emma was sure he had not forgiven her he looked unlike himself,-144.01299999999998
 Too good too excellent creature,-66.952
 It is not an employment to which they have been brought up,-139.41700000000003
 Oh dear that is a great pity,-84.71400000000001
 Nothing can be kinder than her behaviour and she can hardly do all this without being aware of the expectation it raises,-277.15400000000005
 She said all that was reasonable and proper on the business felt the claims of Dr Shirley to repose as she ought saw how very desirable it was that he should have some active respectable young man as a resident curate and was even courteous enough to hint at the advantage of such resident curate s being married,-700.6460000000001
 You and I need not be afraid,-77.042
 And I do envy him Emma,-73.933
 Pray call again as soon as possible and explain the reason of my having expected this in vain,-216.40699999999998
 But I only go for the sake of seeing Edward,-114.01600000000002
 She moved away and sat down,-75.072
 She had been decided in wishing for a Miss Weston,-118.78000000000003
 This delay on the Colonel s side however did not seem to offend or mortify his fair companion in the least for on their breaking up the conference soon afterwards and moving different ways Mrs Jennings very plainly heard Elinor say and with a voice which shewed her to feel what she said,-648.9510000000002
 Miss Hamilton now Mrs Smith had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her life when it had been most valuable,-272.897
 The knowledge of what her mother must be feeling as the carriage stopt at the door of her doubt her dread perhaps her despair and of what SHE had to tell with such knowledge it was impossible to be calm,-482.1980000000001
 He then hastily took leave of them all and left the room,-135.674
 Have you indeed no idea,-65.259
 He had received a good education but on succeeding early in life to a small independence had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged and had satisfied an active cheerful mind and social temper by entering into the militia of his county then embodied,-629.9520000000002
 Elinor sat down to her drawing table as soon as he was out of the house busily employed herself the whole day neither sought nor avoided the mention of his name appeared to interest herself almost as much as ever in the general concerns of the family and if by this conduct she did not lessen her own grief it was at least prevented from unnecessary increase and her mother and sisters were spared much solicitude on her account,-923.8640000000005
 She managed the recital as she hoped with address prepared her anxious listener with caution related simply and honestly the chief points on which Willoughby grounded his apology did justice to his repentance and softened only his protestations of present regard,-510.7130000000002
 Her narration was clear and simple and though it could not be given without emotion it was not accompanied by violent agitation nor impetuous grief THAT belonged rather to the hearer for Marianne listened with horror and cried excessively,-471.6820000000001
 To avoid a comparative poverty which her affection and her society would have deprived of all its horrors I have by raising myself to affluence lost every thing that could make it a blessing,-422.0270000000001
 He will have her at last aye that he will,-119.733
 Frank turned instantly to Emma to claim her former promise and boasted himself an engaged man which his father looked his most perfect approbation of and it then appeared that Mrs Weston was wanting him to dance with Mrs Elton himself and that their business was to help to persuade him into it which was done pretty soon Mr Weston and Mrs Elton led the way Mr Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse followed,-894.0899999999999
 The Crown,-28.866999999999997
 Well said she at last trying to recover herself this is a circumstance which I must think of at least half a day before I can at all comprehend it,-364.955
 You will soon I earnestly hope know her thoroughly yourself No description can describe her,-186.46099999999998
 Their intercourse was painful enough by letter,-95.65000000000002
 We have notice of it in a letter to day,-113.15100000000001
 Poor Mr Woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him in the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming and so anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride Could he have seen the heart he would have cared very little for the lungs but without the most distant imagination of the impending evil without the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of either he repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news he had received from Mr Perry and talked on with much self contentment totally unsuspicious of what they could have told him in return,-1312.8140000000003
 To think of your sending us all your store apples,-132.591
 I do not expect my children to be asked you know,-121.85199999999999
 Now said Harriet you must recollect,-80.84700000000001
 We are always meeting with some old friend or other the streets full of them every morning sure to have plenty of chat and then we get away from them all and shut ourselves in our lodgings and draw in our chairs and are snug as if we were at Kellynch ay or as we used to be even at North Yarmouth and Deal,-785.9310000000004
 But whether I should write this apology or deliver it in person was a point of long debate,-223.77700000000002
 And now I can see it in no other light than as an offering of love,-191.55899999999997
 Has he a house at Allenham,-81.993
 It is remarkable that Emma in the many very many points of view in which she was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey was never struck with any sense of injury to her nephew Henry whose rights as heir expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded,-564.5970000000002
 They were no sooner in the passage than Marianne came hastily out of the parlour apparently in violent affliction with her handkerchief at her eyes and without noticing them ran up stairs,-393.42900000000003
 Captain Wentworth must be out of sight,-82.91
 I wish Hetty had not gone,-69.175
 God knows I have been a very indifferent lover But you understand me Yes you see you understand my feelings and will return them if you can,-327.2699999999999
 Yet though smiling within herself at the mistake she honoured her sister for that blind partiality to Edward which produced it,-270.662
 You must have heard every thing to be sure,-94.277
 Thus a circumstance occurred while the sisters were together in their own room after breakfast which sunk the heart of Mrs Jennings still lower in her estimation because through her own weakness it chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself though Mrs Jennings was governed in it by an impulse of the utmost goodwill,-700.3010000000004
 Emma could not help laughing as she answered Upon my word I believe you know her quite as well as I do But Mr Knightley are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright accepted him,-423.3340000000001
 But I ought to have gone before,-75.21500000000002
 was all her answer but the accent was decisive enough,-132.54000000000002
 It is not that I am without the wish but you know how impossible my father would deem it that James should put to for such a purpose,-329.15600000000006
 But her death which happened ten years before his own produced a great alteration in his home for to supply her loss he invited and received into his house the family of his nephew Mr Henry Dashwood the legal inheritor of the Norland estate and the person to whom he intended to bequeath it,-657.1610000000002
 Anne had done glad that it was over and not absolutely hopeless of doing good,-181.51299999999998
 This explains it,-40.069
 Do not boast of it however said Elinor for it is injustice in both of you,-194.63599999999997
 His disapprobation was expressed but apparently very little regarded,-119.61200000000002
 I cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side but I am sure there is a great wish on the Churchills to keep him to themselves,-302.22
 And so Patty told me and I was excessively shocked indeed,-133.24099999999999
 I had the pleasure of hearing it at Mr Palmer s where I have been dining,-179.107
 were the first words which burst from Captain Wentworth in a tone of despair and as if all his own strength were gone,-284.211
 Respect for right conduct is felt by every body,-108.79
 Surely you must be mistaken,-69.08500000000001
 But upon my word I am scarcely sensible of his attentions being beyond those of other men,-207.33100000000002
 Hers is a line for seeing human nature and she has a fund of good sense and observation which as a companion make her infinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received the best education in the world know nothing worth attending to,-541.8090000000002
 It must be a severe trial to them all,-100.689
 Mr Elliot was in Bath,-57.167
 That is your date,-52.037
 Does it occur to you that there is any one article in which we can retrench,-204.86999999999998
 If we could be certain that it would be only for a while,-144.85
 Well it don t signify talking but when a young man be who he will comes and makes love to a pretty girl and promises marriage he has no business to fly off from his word only because he grows poor and a richer girl is ready to have him,-617.3700000000002
 Mrs Jennings though regretting that she had not been five minutes earlier was satisfied with the compromise and Elinor as she swallowed the chief of it reflected that though its effects on a colicky gout were at present of little importance to her its healing powers on a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried on herself as on her sister,-734.7880000000001
 That is ship plain as it can be Now for the cream,-143.067
 I am sure you will be glad to hear as likewise dear Mrs Jennings I spent two happy hours with him yesterday afternoon he would not hear of our parting though earnestly did I as I thought my duty required urge him to it for prudence sake and would have parted for ever on the spot would he consent to it but he said it should never be he did not regard his mother s anger while he could have my affections our prospects are not very bright to be sure but we must wait and hope for the best he will be ordained shortly and should it ever be in your power to recommend him to any body that has a living to bestow am very sure you will not forget us and dear Mrs Jennings too trust she will speak a good word for us to Sir John or Mr Palmer or any friend that may be able to assist us Poor Anne was much to blame for what she did but she did it for the best so I say nothing hope Mrs Jennings won t think it too much trouble to give us a call should she come this way any morning twould be a great kindness and my cousins would be proud to know her My paper reminds me to conclude and begging to be most gratefully and respectfully remembered to her and to Sir John and Lady Middleton and the dear children when you chance to see them and love to Miss Marianne,-3077.076999999994
 It was before tea stay no it could not be before tea because we were just going to cards and yet it was before tea because I remember thinking Oh,-356.509
 It was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted spirits,-96.767
 A chaise was sent for from Crewkherne and Charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery maid of the family one who having brought up all the children and seen the very last the lingering and long petted Master Harry sent to school after his brothers was now living in her deserted nursery to mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she could get near her and who consequently was only too happy in being allowed to go and help nurse dear Miss Louisa,-1098.133
 Alas,-22.136
 It will be all to one a better match for your sister,-138.008
 She could not consider her partiality for Edward in so prosperous a state as Marianne had believed it,-215.29199999999997
 He would not speak another word to him meet him where he might for all the world,-195.86599999999999
 Do not mistake me however,-63.624
 It is a most uncommon complexion with her dark eye lashes and hair a most distinguishing complexion,-200.60999999999999
 Her second duty now inferior only to her father s claims was to promote Harriet s comfort and endeavour to prove her own affection in some better method than by match making,-395.5700000000001
 I cannot agree with you there said Elinor,-89.97
 no indeed I must protest against any such idea,-117.483
 But Sir John could not prevail,-74.663
 And it is not merely in its follies that they are well read for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or affecting,-337.08
 Leave little Charles to my care,-85.0
 I will give you my authority his friend Colonel Wallis,-116.30900000000001
 my dear how calmly you talk of it and can the Colonel wait two or three months,-201.96699999999998
 Woman s usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they are now or with no important variation,-300.579
 And then I have made a little purchase within this half year East Kingham Farm you must remember the place where old Gibson used to live,-320.923
 She was well paid for her impudence,-79.442
 Her resolution of refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent consolation and happiness,-254.53199999999995
 Only give me a hearing,-66.93
 You know my dear she is going to be to this new lady what Miss Taylor was to us,-226.968
 I have returned Elinor colouring likewise and hardening her heart anew against any compassion for him I have heard it all,-245.91899999999998
 I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I had been of some use but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they may,-325.2800000000001
 These parlors are both too small for such parties of our friends as I hope to see often collected here and I have some thoughts of throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance this with a new drawing room which may be easily added and a bed chamber and garret above will make it a very snug little cottage,-945.6070000000001
 Mr Perry was an intelligent gentlemanlike man whose frequent visits were one of the comforts of Mr Woodhouse s life and upon being applied to he could not but acknowledge though it seemed rather against the bias of inclination that wedding cake might certainly disagree with many perhaps with most people unless taken moderately,-657.0470000000004
 First as being the means of bringing persons of obscure birth into undue distinction and raising men to honours which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of and secondly as it cuts up a man s youth and vigour most horribly a sailor grows old sooner than any other man,-619.1690000000001
 Not that Marianne appeared to distrust the truth of any part of it for she listened to it all with the most steady and submissive attention made neither objection nor remark attempted no vindication of Willoughby and seemed to shew by her tears that she felt it to be impossible,-597.6560000000004
 I cannot conceive a situation more deplorable,-85.049
 In another moment however she found herself in the state of being released from him some one was taking him from her though he had bent down her head so much that his little sturdy hands were unfastened from around her neck and he was resolutely borne away before she knew that Captain Wentworth had done it,-693.9520000000001
 Another song however was soon begged for,-96.331
 It was a commission to me,-58.934
 But last February almost a twelvemonth back she suddenly disappeared,-130.327
 It cannot be long I think before she comes,-114.37499999999999
 My father was certainly disposed to take very kind and proper notice of him,-172.98999999999998
 The carriage was sent for them now,-86.55899999999998
 CHAPTER 47,-22.075000000000003
 To consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope to influence you,-200.624
 What have wealth or grandeur to do with happiness,-114.86200000000001
 He is always with them half lives in the family I believe,-144.535
 Miss Fairfax s compliments and thanks but is quite unequal to any exercise,-162.25900000000001
 He certainly knew what was right nor could she fix on any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed but yet she would have been afraid to answer for his conduct,-374.6369999999999
 But I thought you would,-52.308
 And touching Miss Bates who at that moment passed near Miss Bates are you mad to let your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner,-311.03999999999996
 I knew you would wish it,-69.489
 Jane will be only four miles from Maple Grove,-110.103
 He stopped Emma felt her foot pressed by Mrs Weston and did not herself know what to think,-212.402
 They had been thrown together several weeks they had been living in the same small family party since Henrietta s coming away they must have been depending almost entirely on each other and Louisa just recovering from illness had been in an interesting state and Captain Benwick was not inconsolable,-594.996
 They were obliged to put an end to such an expectation,-120.287
 Mrs Musgrove thinks all her servants so steady that it would be high treason to call it in question but I am sure without exaggeration that her upper house maid and laundry maid instead of being in their business are gadding about the village all day long,-558.5670000000001
 But after all the punishment that misconduct can bring it is still not less misconduct,-192.733
 When I first became intimate in your family I had no other intention no other view in the acquaintance than to pass my time pleasantly while I was obliged to remain in Devonshire more pleasantly than I had ever done before,-503.00500000000005
 Tell me I charge you tell me this moment what it is,-149.563
 Only think of their coming so suddenly,-90.7
 Thank you thank you,-50.768
 Well you will soon be better now replied Anne cheerfully,-126.12400000000002
 Emma could not resist,-43.631
 She had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from her heart for he stopped to hand her out,-254.26899999999995
 said he,-24.481
 He certainly might have heard Mr Elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever done and Mr Elton might not be of an imprudent inconsiderate disposition as to money matters he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them but then Mr Knightley did not make due allowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives,-770.0830000000003
 Every body last night said how well you played,-117.572
 They vindicated him against the base aspersion,-83.38000000000001
 But it had better not be attempted perhaps,-96.675
 Anne judging from her own temperament would have deemed such a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves which Louisa s illness must have so greatly shaken,-347.536
 When there at her own particular request for she was impatient to pour forth her thanks to him for fetching her mother Colonel Brandon was invited to visit her,-353.23999999999995
 I never saw such fine children in my life I declare I quite doat upon them already and indeed I am always distractedly fond of children,-304.25899999999996
 No I do not think we shall,-73.629
 Elinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing that she thought Fanny might have borne with composure an acquisition of wealth to her brother by which neither she nor her child could be possibly impoverished,-444.1540000000001
 I did not know I contradicted any body in calling your mother ill bred,-163.016
 You are forced on exertion,-61.565999999999995
 How can you be so unjust,-70.19200000000001
 You understand the force of influence pretty well Harriet but I would have you so firmly established in good society as to be independent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse,-364.513
 This was her history and particularly interesting it was to Mr Woodhouse who commended her very much for thinking of sending for Perry and only regretted that she had not done it,-376.10700000000014
 But here comes a friend Captain Brigden I shall only say How d ye do,-182.742
 She had a great deal to listen to all the particulars of past sad scenes all the minutiae of distress upon distress which in former conversations had been merely hinted at were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence,-456.4890000000001
 The situation of the house was good,-80.89
 As it was I was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit,-160.32500000000002
 He has imposed on me but he has not injured me,-132.712
 But Emma in her own mind determined that he did know what he was talking about and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to settle early in life and to marry from worthy motives,-418.8450000000001
 and A Em ma Do you understand,-95.81400000000001
 Ah well,-31.384
 We should all have liked her a great deal better and papa and mamma always think it was her great friend Lady Russell s doing that she did not,-339.76000000000005
 I know nothing of the large parties of London sir I never dine with any body,-181.645
 He had been blamable highly blamable in remaining at Norland after he first felt her influence over him to be more than it ought to be,-292.48799999999994
 But this note made me know myself better,-101.43900000000001
 Months,-13.251999999999999
 How do you like it Selina s choice handsome I think but I do not know whether it is not over trimmed I have the greatest dislike to the idea of being over trimmed quite a horror of finery,-446.6440000000001
 You make the most of it I know cried Louisa but if it were really so I should do just the same in her place,-301.83099999999996
 She turned her eyes towards his face and found him with some surprise to be her brother,-208.86899999999997
 I hope not that It is not likely,-88.54499999999999
 replied Miss Bates,-42.852
 she is a sweet creature,-64.608
 I should be very glad to get her so good a mistress,-128.475
 I see what a life I am to lead among you,-131.222
 I do indeed,-30.837000000000003
 Even you used as you are to great sums would hardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like Jane,-301.27399999999994
 Look up to it and be tranquil if you can,-126.357
 Certainly he replied with a sneer I came into Devonshire with no other view,-175.682
 While he staid the Martins were forgotten and on the very morning of his setting off for Bath again Emma to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned judged it best for her to return Elizabeth Martin s visit,-475.31500000000005
 You know said she I cannot think him at all a fit match for Henrietta and considering the alliances which the Musgroves have made she has no right to throw herself away,-380.51200000000006
 The difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards Harriet from her mind while he not only sat at her elbow but was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion,-490.18700000000007
 Mr Shepherd had once mentioned the word advertise but never dared approach it again,-177.69699999999997
 Good God,-28.598
 I hope I shall remember in future said Lady Russell as soon as they were reseated in the carriage not to call at Uppercross in the Christmas holidays,-314.40400000000005
 The confession completely renewed her first shame and the sight of Harriet s tears made her think that she should never be in charity with herself again,-323.90399999999994
 She returned it almost instantly acknowledging the likeness,-103.36500000000002
 Thank you we do indeed,-66.642
 What would you advise me to do,-87.779
 I hope he will be here to morrow for I have a question or two to ask him about myself of some consequence,-263.49399999999997
 Depend upon it that whatever unemployed sum may remain when I make up my accounts in the spring I would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose of it in a manner so painful to you,-451.31800000000004
 It is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected,-119.874
 We have it from Frederick himself,-75.516
 You whom she had known from an infant whom she had seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour to have you now in thoughtless spirits and the pride of the moment laugh at her humble her and before her niece too and before others many of whom certainly some would be entirely guided by your treatment of her This is not pleasant to you Emma and it is very far from pleasant to me but I must I will I will tell you truths while I can satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you can do now,-1453.2260000000003
 Jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour and they had only accomplished some views of St Mark s Place Venice when Frank Churchill entered the room,-341.728
 May I hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball to be given not at Randalls but at the Crown Inn,-371.35999999999996
 One might guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right but I am sure there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to Highbury instead of going with the Campbells to Ireland,-415.641
 brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of private liking of private understanding even between Frank Churchill and Jane,-277.4869999999999
 Conjecture aye sometimes one conjectures right and sometimes one conjectures wrong,-143.874
 She repeated it to Edward,-62.43300000000001
 But what a thing here is by way of a boat,-136.945
 Mr Woodhouse could never allow for Mr Knightley s claims on his brother or any body s claims on Isabella except his own,-272.233
 Elinor who did justice to Mrs Jennings s kindness though its effusions were often distressing and sometimes almost ridiculous made her those acknowledgments and returned her those civilities which her sister could not make or return for herself,-466.57500000000016
 Mr Woodhouse at last was off but Mr Knightley instead of being immediately off likewise sat down again seemingly inclined for more chat,-285.15099999999995
 To some of the best looking of these good people Henrietta was consigned for though partially revived she was quite helpless and in this manner Anne walking by her side and Charles attending to his wife they set forward treading back with feelings unutterable the ground which so lately so very lately and so light of heart they had passed along,-748.2890000000002
 He did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by ill timed conversation,-155.85299999999998
 I thank you ma am sincerely thank you said Marianne with warmth your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever and it would give me such happiness yes almost the greatest happiness I am capable of to be able to accept it,-500.7960000000001
 I must get rid of every thing There it goes and there is an end thank Heaven,-200.53199999999998
 I shall persuade her if I can to go early to bed for I am sure she wants rest,-215.24699999999999
 It was overpowering happiness,-46.366
 what a boat it is,-67.365
 Some one must resolve on being off for Uppercross instantly,-133.803
 If you know it already as surely you must I may be spared,-159.008
 I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case replied Emma but am disposed to side with you Mr Weston,-277.762
 I am sure you think me very strange for enquiring about her in such a way said Lucy eyeing Elinor attentively as she spoke but perhaps there may be reasons I wish I might venture but however I hope you will do me the justice of believing that I do not mean to be impertinent,-624.5809999999999
 It is as pretty a letter as ever I saw and does Lucy s head and heart great credit,-230.39999999999998
 She wanted more vigorous measures a more complete reformation a quicker release from debt a much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity,-324.356
 Every thing was explained to him by Mrs Dashwood and he found fresh reason to rejoice in what he had done for Mr Ferrars since eventually it promoted the interest of Elinor,-386.43000000000006
 Anne drew a little back while the others received his compliments and her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour but he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she nor her friend had taken cold the day before c c which was all as politely done and as politely taken as possible but her part must follow then,-802.4940000000003
 Mr John Knightley was a tall gentleman like and very clever man rising in his profession domestic and respectable in his private character but with reserved manners which prevented his being generally pleasing and capable of being sometimes out of humour,-504.8450000000003
 Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax,-102.18200000000002
 It is to be a morning scheme you know Knightley quite a simple thing,-162.92600000000002
 He must be starved you know that is certain absolutely starved,-129.385
 But Marianne seemed hardly to hear her and on Mrs Jenning s entrance escaped with the precious card,-219.17699999999996
 He has a most excellent mother,-73.731
 One day s delay will not be very material and till I have written to Mr Ferrars I think it ought not to be mentioned to any body else,-329.355
 There was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them as companions to the Dashwoods but the cold insipidity of Lady Middleton was so particularly repulsive that in comparison of it the gravity of Colonel Brandon and even the boisterous mirth of Sir John and his mother in law was interesting,-619.3930000000003
 Poor man,-29.957
 Where could you possibly hear it Mr Knightley,-102.023
 There being nothing to eat he could only have some play and as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother he began to fasten himself upon her as she knelt in such a way that busy as she was about Charles she could not shake him off,-606.9440000000002
 Had you married you must have been always poor,-107.605
 They must both have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and concealment,-194.20299999999997
 She went she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door but had not been into the house since the morning after Box Hill when poor Jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected The fear of being still unwelcome determined her though assured of their being at home to wait in the passage and send up her name She heard Patty announcing it but no such bustle succeeded as poor Miss Bates had before made so happily intelligible No she heard nothing but the instant reply of Beg her to walk up and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs by Jane herself coming eagerly forward as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient Emma had never seen her look so well so lovely so engaging,-1761.387000000001
 The name of Anne Elliot said he has long had an interesting sound to me,-184.653
 You have made yourself too clear,-74.149
 We must allow for the effect of shade you know,-118.62900000000002
 But on seeing them together she became perfectly satisfied,-111.09500000000001
 A very successful visit I saw all the three ladies and felt very much obliged to you for your preparatory hint,-248.94499999999996
 But Colonel Brandon does not seem to have any idea of the living s being enough to allow them to marry,-244.91299999999998
 Mr Knightley who had nothing of ceremony about him was offering by his short decided answers an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies and civil hesitations of the other,-343.975
 You must begin your improvements on this house observed Elinor and your difficulties will soon vanish,-202.148
 She did not really like her,-68.43299999999999
 And I declare if she is not gone away without finishing her wine,-158.972
 Sir John called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weather that morning allowed him to get out of doors and Marianne s accident being related to him he was eagerly asked whether he knew any gentleman of the name of Willoughby at Allenham,-562.9480000000001
 Is this true,-43.788000000000004
 Harriet had business at Ford s Emma thought it most prudent to go with her,-181.97
 THEY only knew how little he had had to tempt him to be disobedient and how small was the consolation beyond the consciousness of doing right that could remain to him in the loss of friends and fortune,-462.38700000000006
 The following day brought news from Richmond to throw every thing else into the background,-184.403
 I can see nobody said she and up she got and would go away and that was what made us keep you waiting and extremely sorry and ashamed we were,-367.91
 I will call another day and hear the pianoforte,-107.65200000000002
 Well said he we have brought you some strangers,-115.49900000000001
 I have been to the theatre and secured a box for to morrow night,-149.24300000000002
 They will be so near their own stable,-97.061
 Now Mary I declare it was so I heard it myself and you were in the other room,-218.84099999999998
 When I have made up my mind I have made it and Henrietta seemed entirely to have made up hers to call at Winthrop to day and yet she was as near giving it up out of nonsensical complaisance,-474.10100000000017
 For my own part said he I am excessively fond of a cottage there is always so much comfort so much elegance about them,-294.49600000000004
 He could refer Sir Walter to all who knew him and certainly the pains he had been taking on this the first opportunity of reconciliation to be restored to the footing of a relation and heir presumptive was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject,-563.1300000000001
 You must know I have a vast dislike to puppies quite a horror of them,-179.03799999999998
 They were just approaching the house where lived Mrs and Miss Bates,-140.267
 And so much was said in this way that Anne thought she could not do better than impart among them the general inclination to which she was privy and persuaded them all to go to Lyme at once,-440.1250000000001
 Mrs Weston it is too calm a censure,-97.44500000000002
 When they had all talked a little while in harmony of the weather and Mrs Weston she found herself abruptly addressed with,-260.274
 The time now approached for Lady Russell s return the day was even fixed and Anne being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettled was looking forward to an early removal to Kellynch and beginning to think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it,-595.449
 Don t let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman,-189.87300000000002
 You probably have been less surprized than any of us for you have had your suspicions I have not forgotten that you once tried to give me a caution I wish I had attended to it but with a sinking voice and a heavy sigh I seem to have been doomed to blindness,-626.561
 Sir John had dropped hints of past injuries and disappointments which justified her belief of his being an unfortunate man and she regarded him with respect and compassion,-350.635
 The letter I am looking for was one written by Mr Elliot to him before our marriage and happened to be saved why one can hardly imagine,-334.0560000000001
 She would be respectable and happy and Emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the world to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a man or if not quite the luckiest to yield only to herself,-480.58300000000014
 so far off and the air so bad,-108.971
 But it should be so no more,-76.92500000000001
 There was something in her style of beauty to please them particularly,-145.236
 It must be something extraordinary that could make Colonel Brandon leave my breakfast table so suddenly,-197.57099999999997
 My advice said Mrs Weston kindly and persuasively I certainly do feel tempted to give,-187.636
 It was a look however very well bestowed for it relieved her own feelings and gave no intelligence to him,-232.18899999999996
 Happy those who can remain at Highbury,-96.24
 Yes said Emma I hope I do,-80.08700000000002
 No engagement,-30.604
 Instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they waited for dinner he was talking to Miss Fairfax,-250.154
 My dear sir do not make a stranger of me,-118.98400000000001
 He will suffer enough in them,-74.771
 The Eltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings and of the use to be made of their barouche landau and Jane Fairfax was still at her grandmother s and as the return of the Campbells from Ireland was again delayed and August instead of Midsummer fixed for it she was likely to remain there full two months longer provided at least she were able to defeat Mrs Elton s activity in her service and save herself from being hurried into a delightful situation against her will,-1083.241
 When the time proposed drew near Mrs Weston s fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse,-241.82899999999998
 I am glad of it with all my heart but really you did not look it,-175.736
 This decision checked Mary s eagerness and stopped her short in the midst of the Elliot countenance,-210.02499999999998
 My dear Mrs Weston do not take to match making,-120.653
 I wish I may not sink into poor Emma with him at once His tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther,-280.2869999999999
 Another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty and second marriages and then you can have nothing farther to ask,-295.811
 Nobody could be so imprudent,-66.72
 Very sincerely did Emma wish to do so but it was not immediately in her power,-189.02300000000002
 They found Mrs Musgrove and her daughter within and by themselves and Anne had the kindest welcome from each,-232.807
 It was necessary to the happiness of both for however dissimilar in temper and outward behaviour they strongly resembled each other in that total want of talent and taste which confined their employments unconnected with such as society produced within a very narrow compass,-535.5340000000001
 Jane did not look round,-69.086
 I certainly should have represented it to Edward in a very strong light,-149.89499999999998
 Mr Knightley who for some reason best known to himself had certainly taken an early dislike to Frank Churchill was only growing to dislike him more,-319.646
 His bright proud eye spoke the conviction that he was nice and Anne Elliot was not out of his thoughts when he more seriously described the woman he should wish to meet with,-406.22300000000007
 Christmas weather observed Mr Elton,-71.95400000000001
 I shall have a charming account to carry to Fanny said he as he walked back with his sister,-224.62899999999996
 With a little reserve of manner Emma continued,-105.05800000000002
 He had been prevented setting off for Thornberry but I really forget by what for I was in a hurry and could not much attend and I can only answer for his being determined not to be delayed in his return,-478.0200000000001
 She was soon undressed and in bed and as she seemed desirous of being alone her sister then left her and while she waited the return of Mrs Jennings had leisure enough for thinking over the past,-429.87299999999993
 Mr Hayter had some property of his own but it was insignificant compared with Mr Musgrove s and while the Musgroves were in the first class of society in the country the young Hayters would from their parents inferior retired and unpolished way of living and their own defective education have been hardly in any class at all but for their connexion with Uppercross this eldest son of course excepted who had chosen to be a scholar and a gentleman and who was very superior in cultivation and manners to all the rest,-1112.7000000000003
 She only wished that it were less openly shewn and once or twice did venture to suggest the propriety of some self command to Marianne,-307.08000000000004
 They met for the sake of eating drinking and laughing together playing at cards or consequences or any other game that was sufficiently noisy,-296.52
 And it cannot be for the value of our custom now for what is our consumption of bread you know,-242.555
 Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin,-64.667
 Though heavy and feverish with a pain in her limbs and a cough and a sore throat a good night s rest was to cure her entirely and it was with difficulty that Elinor prevailed on her when she went to bed to try one or two of the simplest of the remedies,-618.9800000000002
 We never could agree in our choice of a profession,-130.31900000000002
 She went to Mrs Goddard s accordingly the very next day to undergo the necessary penance of communication and a severe one it was She had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously feeding to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis judging in all her ideas on one subject all her observations all her convictions all her prophecies for the last six weeks,-907.2850000000007
 Good Mrs Stokes would not know her own room again,-128.816
 how eloquent at least were her wishes on the side of early warm attachment and a cheerful confidence in futurity against that over anxious caution which seems to insult exertion and distrust Providence,-418.4900000000001
 When he talked she heard the same voice and discerned the same mind,-164.943
 Anne sighed and blushed and smiled in pity and disdain either at her friend or herself,-204.192
 That Lady Russell of steady age and character and extremely well provided for should have no thought of a second marriage needs no apology to the public which is rather apt to be unreasonably discontented when a woman does marry again than when she does not but Sir Walter s continuing in singleness requires explanation,-683.9030000000002
 But the usual fate of Anne attended her in having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on,-227.023
 One ought to be at Enscombe and know the ways of the family before one decides upon what he can do replied Mrs Weston,-284.714
 Invited,-13.251999999999999
 The family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex,-128.514
 She saw no reason against their being happy,-98.378
 No I cannot think that,-60.102000000000004
 No I thank you I have nothing to trouble you with,-123.06099999999999
 yes very,-32.714999999999996
 I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject replied Emma smiling but you do not mean to deny that there was a time and not very distant either when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him,-513.9410000000001
 Captain Wentworth is not very gallant by you Anne though he was so attentive to me,-192.56900000000002
 They set off,-41.656000000000006
 My dear Jane are you sure you did not wet your feet It was but a drop or two but I am so afraid but Mr Frank Churchill was so extremely and there was a mat to step upon I shall never forget his extreme politeness Oh,-550.2200000000001
 The two ladies looked over it together and he sat smiling and talking to them the whole time in a voice a little subdued but very audible to every body,-358.82400000000007
 It will be the only difference,-67.025
 She might assist his resolution or reconcile him to it she might give just praise to Harriet or by representing to him his own independence relieve him from that state of indecision which must be more intolerable than any alternative to such a mind as his They had reached the house,-623.5630000000001
 Talks of his being going on so well,-90.438
 Willoughby,-19.403
 said he turning his eyes towards Jane,-91.21000000000001
 My protege as you call him is a sensible man and sense will always have attractions for me,-217.80199999999996
 My visits to Mrs Smith are never repeated within the twelvemonth,-142.499
 Perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her inferior in talent and all the elegancies of mind,-286.928
 They ought to feel what is due to you as my sister,-141.954
 Dear Ma am replied Elinor smiling at the difference of the complaints for which it was recommended how good you are,-258.6859999999999
 Mine I confess are exhausted,-64.642
 Not a syllable passed aloud,-67.345
 And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me said Emma and a very considerable one that I made the match myself,-284.42600000000004
 no my love but you will soon be tired,-113.67999999999999
 She need not trouble herself to pity him,-103.389
 What instances must pass before them of ardent disinterested self denying attachment of heroism fortitude patience resignation of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices that ennoble us most,-352.79600000000005
 His appearance was very neat and he looked like a sensible young man but his person had no other advantage and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen she thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in Harriet s inclination,-537.6690000000001
 One ought to use the same caution perhaps in judging of the conduct of any one individual of any one family but Enscombe I believe certainly must not be judged by general rules she is so very unreasonable and every thing gives way to her,-544.6240000000001
 And who was this uncle,-65.771
 They were come too late in the year for any amusement or variety which Lyme as a public place might offer,-254.00299999999996
 I honour his sincerity,-52.065999999999995
 She laughed because she was disappointed and though she liked him for his attentions and thought them all whether in friendship admiration or playfulness extremely judicious they were not winning back her heart,-406.44100000000014
 They are quite different creatures with you,-84.79299999999999
 Mr Elliot had attempted no apology and shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family as Sir Walter considered him unworthy of it all acquaintance between them had ceased,-393.91100000000006
 Elinor s lips had moved with her mother s and when the moment of action was over she wished that she had shaken hands with him too,-316.127
 Only think,-31.378
 The less worthy females were to come in the evening with Miss Bates Miss Fairfax and Miss Smith but already at dinner they were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be general and while politics and Mr Elton were talked over Emma could fairly surrender all her attention to the pleasantness of her neighbour,-676.0940000000002
 So we must be as merry as we can that she may not be dwelling upon such gloomy things,-237.36199999999997
 She believed he had been drinking too much of Mr Weston s good wine and felt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense,-287.11400000000003
 Marianne s preserver as Margaret with more elegance than precision styled Willoughby called at the cottage early the next morning to make his personal enquiries,-299.036
 Impossible I never can call you any thing but Mr,-130.211
 said he quietly and looking at her of what nature,-125.887
 Anne had always felt that she would pretend what was proper on her arrival but the complaisance of the others was unlooked for,-275.8889999999999
 This would not do she immediately stopped under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing of her half boot and stooping down in complete occupation of the footpath begged them to have the goodness to walk on and she would follow in half a minute,-566.4090000000002
 said Lucy as they walked up the stairs together for the Middletons arrived so directly after Mrs Jennings that they all followed the servant at the same time There is nobody here but you that can feel for me I declare I can hardly stand,-546.061
 we shall certainly take that post,-84.581
 The box was brought and placed before her and Mrs Smith sighing over it as she unlocked it said,-234.96299999999997
 I beg your pardon,-43.97
 What immediately followed is known,-68.914
 Captain Wentworth left his seat and walked to the fire place probably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards and taking a station with less bare faced design by Anne,-401.62700000000007
 Have you heard from her yourself this morning,-96.19900000000001
 Anne found in Mrs Smith the good sense and agreeable manners which she had almost ventured to depend on and a disposition to converse and be cheerful beyond her expectation,-371.435
 We allowed unnecessary room,-56.326
 To walk by the side of this child and talk to and question her was the most natural thing in the world or would have been the most natural had she been acting just then without design and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead without any obligation of waiting for her,-662.8350000000002
 It had increased her comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands,-179.91299999999998
 Of all houses in the kingdom Mrs Bragge s is the one I would most wish to see you in,-248.051
 Selina has entirely given up music never touches the instrument though she played sweetly,-188.24999999999997
 Mr Cole gave me a hint of it six weeks ago,-135.863
 What Anne first heard was,-68.91499999999999
 However I don t think her hardly at all handsomer than you I assure you for I think you both excessively pretty and so does Mr Palmer too I am sure though we could not get him to own it last night,-499.80100000000004
 Emma denied none of it aloud and agreed to none of it in private,-174.13400000000001
 Emma s project of forgetting Mr Elton for a while made her rather sorry to find when they had all taken their places that he was close to her,-349.065
 In a week or two I suppose we shall be going and I trust Edward will not be very unwilling to accept the charge,-280.13199999999995
 The character of Mrs Churchill the grief of her husband her mind glanced over them both with awe and compassion and then rested with lightened feelings on how Frank might be affected by the event how benefited how freed,-482.2350000000002
 Your neighbourhood is increasing and you mix more with it,-130.255
