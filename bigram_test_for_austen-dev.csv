 There was a momentary expression in Captain Wentworth s face at this speech a certain glance of his bright eye and curl of his handsome mouth which convinced Anne that instead of sharing in Mrs Musgrove s kind wishes as to her son he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him but it was too transient an indulgence of self amusement to be detected by any who understood him less than herself in another moment he was perfectly collected and serious and almost instantly afterwards coming up to the sofa on which she and Mrs Musgrove were sitting took a place by the latter and entered into conversation with her in a low voice about her son doing it with so much sympathy and natural grace as shewed the kindest consideration for all that was real and unabsurd in the parent s feelings,-1448.296

 The house belonged to people in business,-79.249
 He could not forgive her but he could not be unfeeling,-93.937

 He is not a gallant man but he is a very humane one and this considering Jane Fairfax s ill health would appear a case of humanity to him and for an act of unostentatious kindness there is nobody whom I would fix on more than on Mr Knightley,-465.173
 How soon he had walked himself into the proper resolution however how soon an opportunity of exercising it occurred in what manner he expressed himself and how he was received need not be particularly told,-362.431
 What has it been but a system of hypocrisy and deceit espionage and treachery To come among us with professions of openness and simplicity and such a league in secret to judge us all Here have we been the whole winter and spring completely duped fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth and honour with two people in the midst of us who may have been carrying round comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both to hear They must take the consequence if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable,-1117.394

 I have heard it asserted said John Knightley that the same sort of handwriting often prevails in a family and where the same master teaches it is natural enough,-272.482

 To Highbury in general it brought no material change,-104.972
 How came they acquainted,-56.287
 There are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful and till his sentiments are fully known you cannot wonder at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality by believing or calling it more than it is,-415.791
 At any rate I shall expect you to morrow,-97.128
 Her Christian name I always forget her Christian name,-103.545
 He is the curate of the parish I dare say,-91.37
 I am sure they were talking of me and I could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me do you think he was Miss Woodhouse,-238.665
 Will Mr Frank Churchill pass through Bath as well as Oxford,-121.335
 Mamma you are not doing me justice,-85.418
 What would you do yourself,-57.827
 I know it is replied her mother seriously or after such a warning I should be the last to encourage such affection or even to be pleased by it,-258.441
 You always called me Mr Knightley and from habit it has not so very formal a sound And yet it is formal,-232.972
 She and Mary were actually setting forward for the Great House where as she afterwards learnt they must inevitably have found him when they were stopped by the eldest boy s being at that moment brought home in consequence of a bad fall,-439.365
 Surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she had just quitted where they found only Willoughby who was leaning against the mantel piece with his back towards them,-313.626
 But I do assure you it was so for all that and I will tell you how it happened,-159.219
 Harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account,-97.621
 He held out his hand,-56.252
 Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret escorted by Mr Elliot and Colonel Wallis who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant advanced into the room,-252.659
 I have not always known their writing apart,-87.65
 Your marrying will be equal to the match at Randalls,-101.31
 Elinor I have been cruelly used but not by Willoughby,-96.208
 If you had only sent him to Westminster as well as myself instead of sending him to Mr Pratt s all this would have been prevented,-241.329
 In half a minute they were in the room,-78.946
 He appeared to have a very open temper certainly a very cheerful and lively one she could observe nothing wrong in his notions a great deal decidedly right he spoke of his uncle with warm regard was fond of talking of him said he would be the best man in the world if he were left to himself and though there was no being attached to the aunt he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect,-805.471
 It was growing quite dusk however before they were in the neighbourhood of Uppercross and there had been total silence among them for some time Henrietta leaning back in the corner with a shawl over her face giving the hope of her having cried herself to sleep when as they were going up their last hill Anne found herself all at once addressed by Captain Wentworth,-635.984
 Do help me,-36.574
 Mrs Weston s friends were all made happy by her safety and if the satisfaction of her well doing could be increased to Emma it was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl,-348.942
 Four o clock depend upon it he will be here by three was Mr Weston s quick amendment and so ended a most satisfactory meeting,-263.621
 said he to Emma and trying as he spoke to catch Miss Fairfax s eye,-146.849
 I am sure I should have seen it in a moment if Mrs Ferrars had took a dislike to me,-168.5
 Emma saw how Mr Weston understood these joyous prospects,-106.29
 Her sufferings have been very severe,-68.716
 Beyond you three is there a creature in the world whom I would not rather suspect of evil than Willoughby whose heart I know so well,-276.068
 By whom can you have heard it mentioned,-88.97
 She would have been glad to know when these difficulties were to cease this opposition was to yield when Mrs Ferrars would be reformed and her son be at liberty to be happy,-301.141
 His information and prospects as to Enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated Mrs Churchill was recovering and he dared not yet even in his own imagination fix a time for coming to Randalls again,-398.822
 She could soon tell at what coachmaker s the new carriage was building by what painter Mr Willoughby s portrait was drawn and at what warehouse Miss Grey s clothes might be seen,-348.87
 I had a few lines on parish business from Mr Weston this morning and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened,-269.074
 The day at Lyme the fall from the Cobb might influence her health her nerves her courage her character to the end of her life as thoroughly as it appeared to have influenced her fate,-367.638
 Some vague report had reached her before of my attachment to some young lady in Devonshire and what had passed within her observation the preceding evening had marked who the young lady was and made her more jealous than ever,-426.448
 Mr Perry had been to Mrs Goddard s to attend a sick child and Miss Nash had seen him and he had told Miss Nash that as he was coming back yesterday from Clayton Park he had met Mr Elton and found to his great surprize that Mr Elton was actually on his road to London and not meaning to return till the morrow though it was the whist club night which he had been never known to miss before and Mr Perry had remonstrated with him about it and told him how shabby it was in him their best player to absent himself and tried very much to persuade him to put off his journey only one day but it would not do Mr Elton had been determined to go on and had said in a very particular way indeed that he was going on business which he would not put off for any inducement in the world and something about a very enviable commission and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious,-1592.729
 Had not Mrs Weston any letter about her to produce,-110.511
 what do you mean,-45.728
 I had not the smallest intention of asking him said Elizabeth with affected carelessness but he gave so many hints so Mrs Clay says at least,-275.02
 So seldom that a letter among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom is even carried wrong and not one in a million I suppose actually lost,-314.957
 Mr Elliot looking up with so much respect,-79.39
 If ever there were people who without having great wealth themselves had every thing they could wish for I am sure it is us,-237.15
 He had never been in the room at the Crown in his life did not know the people who kept it by sight Oh,-208.854
 Only think of those sweet verses To Miss,-95.651
 The real evils indeed of Emma s situation were the power of having rather too much her own way and a disposition to think a little too well of herself these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments,-403.986
 cried Marianne again So calm so cheerful how have you been supported,-147.848
 Harriet was to be there in the evening and the Bateses,-98.368
 Mr Shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman s family and mentioned a place and Anne after the little pause which followed added,-244.323
 Low I am afraid sir very low answered his son but we shall be indulgent especially to any one who leads the way,-224.149
 I met one as I came Madness in such weather absolute madness,-127.14
 Mrs Dashwood would have interrupted her instantly with soothing tenderness had not Elinor who really wished to hear her sister s unbiased opinion by an eager sign engaged her silence,-312.992
 Charles Anne must not it,-54.474
 It was much easier to chat than to study much pleasanter to let her imagination range and work at Harriet s fortune than to be labouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts and the only literary pursuit which engaged Harriet at present the only mental provision she was making for the evening of life was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort that she could meet with into a thin quarto of hot pressed paper made up by her friend and ornamented with ciphers and trophies,-907.081
 oh,-22.524
 This was all sent with the instrument,-70.032
 And the dried cherries too,-46.237
 Mrs John Knightley was a pretty elegant little woman of gentle quiet manners and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate wrapt up in her family a devoted wife a doating mother and so tenderly attached to her father and sister that but for these higher ties a warmer love might have seemed impossible,-543.536
 Surry is full of beauties,-69.009
 I was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire,-113.56
 As moderate as those of the rest of the world I believe,-109.299
 And so I am not to be surprized that Jane Fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her,-160.85
 Such behaviour as this so exactly the reverse of her own appeared no more meritorious to Marianne than her own had seemed faulty to her,-246.738
 Exactly so The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth I have not a doubt of your success,-211.529
,-8.769
 Very beautiful indeed replied Emma and she spoke so kindly that he gratefully burst out,-165.725
 Marianne I dare say will not leave her room again this evening,-123.401
 Anne and me are to go the latter end of January to some relations who have been wanting us to visit them these several years,-265.346
 It seems on the contrary to have been a perfectly spontaneous untaught feeling on his side and this surprises me,-188.671
 You saw what she said,-49.553
 A week to morrow And I have hardly begun to enjoy myself,-126.902
 what can you possibly have to do,-75.128
 Well mother I have done something for you that you will like,-112.608
 Elinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming such feelings she only endeavoured to counteract them by working on others represented it therefore as a measure which would fix the time of her returning to that dear mother whom she so much wished to see in a more eligible more comfortable manner than any other plan could do and perhaps without any greater delay,-669.397
 I cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor with praise encouragement and offers of service that she will not be continually detailing her magnificent intentions from the procuring her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche landau,-537.889
 That I am sure you would,-51.195
 Mr Knightley is coming too,-51.609
 Emma who was not really at all frightened herself tranquillised this excess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs Goddard s experience and care but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she could not wish to reason away which she would rather feed and assist than not she added soon afterwards as if quite another subject,-599.925
 She could only resolve to avoid such self delusion in future and think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing of having one such truly sympathising friend as Lady Russell,-327.532
 I managed it extremely well,-49.401
 Two such she did not want,-66.536
 She looked back as well as she could but it was all confusion,-109.728
 My beau indeed,-39.146
 Why does not he try Bath Indeed he should,-106.083
 Ah,-15.669
 How do you do Mrs Ford,-65.152
 Sir Walter Elizabeth and Mrs Clay returned one morning from Laura Place with a sudden invitation from Lady Dalrymple for the same evening and Anne was already engaged to spend that evening in Westgate Buildings,-356.96
 The gentleman offered his services and perceiving that her modesty declined what her situation rendered necessary took her up in his arms without farther delay and carried her down the hill,-355.727
 Did you not think him dreadful low spirited when he was at Barton,-130.043
 and to see you in such excellent looks I would not have missed this meeting for the world,-169.115
 We have carriages to fetch and convey her home and we live in a style which could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax at any time the least inconvenient I should be extremely displeased if Wright were to send us up such a dinner as could make me regret having asked more than Jane Fairfax to partake of it,-596.864
 And so saying she took the screens out of her sister in law s hands to admire them herself as they ought to be admired,-246.48
 and Elizabeth to do her justice had in the first ardour of female alarm set seriously to think what could be done and had finally proposed these two branches of economy to cut off some unnecessary charities and to refrain from new furnishing the drawing room to which expedients she afterwards added the happy thought of their taking no present down to Anne as had been the usual yearly custom,-714.135
 You had better leave me was all the notice that her sister received from her,-138.544
 The contrast between Mrs Churchill s importance in the world and Jane Fairfax s struck her one was every thing the other nothing and she sat musing on the difference of woman s destiny and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed till roused by Miss Bates s saying,-493.957
 A little disordered always the first twenty four hours of going to sea but never knew what sickness was afterwards,-217.747
 What years of felicity that man in all human calculation has before him Assured of the love of such a woman the disinterested love for Jane Fairfax s character vouches for her disinterestedness every thing in his favour equality of situation I mean as far as regards society and all the habits and manners that are important equality in every point but one and that one since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted such as must increase his felicity for it will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants A man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from and he who can do it where there is no doubt of her regard must I think be the happiest of mortals Frank Churchill is indeed the favourite of fortune,-1406.116
 I have taken some pains for your sake and for Robert Martin s sake whom I have always had reason to believe as much in love with her as ever to get acquainted with her,-314.557
 Emma your infatuation about that girl blinds you,-94.711
 continued Lucy after wiping her eyes I think whether it would not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely,-229.868
 It would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfied with her situation for a change is not very probable there,-223.714
 you will think very differently when you are married,-90.838
 When she could give another glance he had moved away,-101.896
 Before the end of September Emma attended Harriet to church and saw her hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction as no remembrances even connected with Mr Elton as he stood before them could impair Perhaps indeed at that time she scarcely saw Mr Elton but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on herself Robert Martin and Harriet Smith the latest couple engaged of the three were the first to be married,-838.571
 She could not think that Harriet s solace or her own sins required more and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they returned but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive Mr Elton is so good to the poor,-628.028
 It was adventuring too far assuming too much making light of what ought to be serious a trick of what ought to be simple,-239.316
 Emma my dear Emma,-39.228
 Had she left her where she ought and where he had told her she ought Had she not with a folly which no tongue could express prevented her marrying the unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy and respectable in the line of life to which she ought to belong all would have been safe none of this dreadful sequel would have been,-636.974
 Mermaids and sharks,-22.509
 Emma seriously hoped she would,-56.843
 I am going to London to spend a few days with John and Isabella,-133.463
 She was not so materially cast down however but that a little time and the return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives,-198.633
 At length she replied,-49.995
 Henrietta asked him what he thought of you when they went away and he said You were so altered he should not have known you again,-251.46
 Me,-21.745
 And very nice young ladies they both are I hardly know one from the other,-160.29
 If I could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired but is Mrs Stokes to be trusted,-177.012
 I am sure Miss Fairfax must have found the evening pleasant Emma,-107.68
 I believe I have lived as much on board as most women and I know nothing superior to the accommodations of a man of war,-233.491
 You had better order the carriage directly my love said she I dare say we shall be able to get along if we set off directly and if we do come to any thing very bad I can get out and walk,-406.494
 While waiting for the carriage she found Mr Knightley by her side,-116.25
 I think differently now time and sickness and sorrow have given me other notions but at that period I must own I saw nothing reprehensible in what Mr Elliot was doing,-320.656
 Never madam cried he affronted in his turn never I assure you,-132.499
 She felt immediately that she should like him and there was a well bred ease of manner and a readiness to talk which convinced her that he came intending to be acquainted with her and that acquainted they soon must be,-373.85
 At this moment an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma s brain with regard to Jane Fairfax this charming Mr Dixon and the not going to Ireland she said with the insidious design of farther discovery,-387.617
 you would rather talk of her person than her mind would you,-119.639
 I assure you the utmost stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in private life,-228.072
 Campbell,-24.601
 As soon as they returned to the carriage Mrs Jennings was eager for information but as Elinor wished to spread as little as possible intelligence that had in the first place been so unfairly obtained she confined herself to the brief repetition of such simple particulars as she felt assured that Lucy for the sake of her own consequence would choose to have known,-626.018
 And I assure you I never was better pleased in my life and I wish you joy of it with all my heart,-196.462
 This is all that I can relate of the how where and when,-126.82
 Miss Nash had told her all this and had talked a great deal more about Mr Elton and said looking so very significantly at her that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be but she only knew that any woman whom Mr Elton could prefer she should think the luckiest woman in the world for beyond a doubt Mr Elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness,-671.604
 For their own comfort they would much rather have remained at least all the morning in Mrs Jennings s house but it was not a thing to be urged against the wishes of everybody,-317.37
 We shall never agree about him cried Emma but that is nothing extraordinary,-131.624
 He will be able to tell her how we all are,-103.24
 And yet a few minutes afterwards she felt as if their being in company with each other under their present circumstances could only be exposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most mischievous kind,-318.768
 Before he could return to his chair it was taken by Mrs Weston,-128.891
 How could he answer it to himself to rob his child and his only child too of so large a sum,-229.744
 Their attention was called towards the others,-78.203
 I think very well of Mr Elton and this is the only way I have of doing him a service,-181.272
 You speak very properly,-51.956
 The usual character of them has nothing for me,-92.549
 Miss Campbell always was absolutely plain but extremely elegant and amiable,-134.751
 An admiral speaks his own consequence and at the same time can never make a baronet look small,-193.543
 You are right,-31.289
 Oh yes I dare say you will,-62.872
 It was not possible that the occurrence should not be strongly recommending each to the other,-148.229
 One morning about a week after his leaving the country Marianne was prevailed on to join her sisters in their usual walk instead of wandering away by herself,-288.741
 There is an openness a quickness almost a bluntness in Mr Weston which every body likes in him because there is so much good humour with it but that would not do to be copied,-335.704
 Yes quite a proposal of marriage and a very good letter at least she thought so,-156.345
 Her own behaviour had been so very improper,-82.928
 You are too obliging my dear Miss Woodhouse but we really must take leave,-139.834
 Marianne began now to perceive that the desperation which had seized her at sixteen and a half of ever seeing a man who could satisfy her ideas of perfection had been rash and unjustifiable,-329.217
 Still however affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment,-199.101
 The gruel came and supplied a great deal to be said much praise and many comments undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution and pretty severe Philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with tolerable but unfortunately among the failures which the daughter had to instance the most recent and therefore most prominent was in her own cook at South End a young woman hired for the time who never had been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel thin but not too thin,-930.168
 To be constantly living with an ill tempered person must be dreadful,-132.926
 you answer as discreetly as she could do herself,-89.126
 I am sorry we cannot see your sister Miss Dashwood said Miss Steele,-124.649
 Yes all of us Mrs Elton would have us come,-104.83
 And yet this woman who knows what her art may have been how long it may have been premeditated and how deeply contrived by her Who is she Who can she be Whom did I ever hear him talk of as young and attractive among his female acquaintance Oh,-512.569
 The sea is no beautifier certainly sailors do grow old betimes I have observed it they soon lose the look of youth,-238.794
 I am quite sure he replied speaking very distinctly that he told me she had accepted him and that there was no obscurity nothing doubtful in the words he used and I think I can give you a proof that it must be so,-392.488
 Twice did I leave them purposely together in the course of the last morning and each time did he most unaccountably follow me out of the room,-271.06
 But Marianne in her place would not have done so little,-97.682
 I have no reason to think ill of her not the least except that such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal,-453.5
 I cannot keep my eyes from it,-63.901
 I am most happy to hear it but only Jane Fairfax one knows to be so very accomplished and superior and exactly Emma s age,-251.256
 A man who had been in motion since eight o clock in the morning and might now have been still who had been long talking and might have been silent who had been in more than one crowd and might have been alone Such a man to quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside and on the evening of a cold sleety April day rush out again into the world Could he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken back his wife there would have been a motive but his coming would probably prolong rather than break up the party,-1005.054
 But now it is all too late,-67.009
 Is she still in town,-56.949
 In Mrs Dashwood s estimation he was as faultless as in Marianne s and Elinor saw nothing to censure in him but a propensity in which he strongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her sister of saying too much what he thought on every occasion without attention to persons or circumstances,-521.414
 He looked at them slightly without seeming to know who they were and merely nodded to Mrs Jennings from the other side of the room,-236.822
 Many vain solicitudes would be prevented many awkwardnesses smoothed by it,-114.721
 It was indeed a highly prized letter,-74.694
 Reserved how in what manner,-58.975
 I have no notion of people s making such a to do about money and greatness,-164.759
 This was a subject which ensured Marianne s attention and she was beginning to describe her own admiration of these scenes and to question him more minutely on the objects that had particularly struck him when Edward interrupted her by saying You must not enquire too far Marianne remember I have no knowledge in the picturesque and I shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste if we come to particulars,-736.119
 You made a lucky guess and that is all that can be said,-122.868
 Such schemes as these are nothing without numbers,-104.7
 Emma in good spirits too from the amusement afforded her mind by the expectation of Mr Frank Churchill was willing to forget his late improprieties and be as well satisfied with him as before and on his making Harriet his very first subject was ready to listen with most friendly smiles,-497.364
 It could be protracted no longer,-56.55
 She could not stay,-35.465
 What indeed ma am,-48.517
 Lady Russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject and gave it much serious consideration,-157.813
 They had been once more in the same room,-76.0
 She was in gay spirits and would have prolonged the conversation wanting to hear the particulars of his suspicions every look described and all the wheres and hows of a circumstance which highly entertained her but his gaiety did not meet hers,-397.594
 Her early impressions were incurable,-57.525
 Edward it is so and I will say it,-77.776
 No no Frederick is not a man to whine and complain he has too much spirit for that,-175.354
 Here is my sketch of the fourth who was a baby,-109.898
 yes I am quite aware of that,-68.602
 She would be never led into temptation nor left for it to find her out,-152.549
 He was a nervous man easily depressed fond of every body that he was used to and hating to part with them hating change of every kind,-263.999
 Knightley s Alas,-41.705
 Emma was sorry to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like through three long months to be always doing more than she wished and less than she ought,-304.249
 She had never received from her more than outward attention nothing beyond the observances of complaisance had never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry against previous inclination,-300.753
 After an interval of some minutes however he began with,-108.296
 There could be no doubt as to Miss Elliot,-76.936
 I know it all I know it all cried Mrs Smith,-92.477
 I wished for him again the next summer when I had still the same luck in the Mediterranean,-160.035
 Her father s business was to announce James s being gone out to put the horses to preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls and she had therefore an immediate excuse for disappearing,-353.126
 But not a bit did Walter stir,-84.745
 I have quite a horror of upstarts,-63.506
 How attentive she is to think of every body Thank you my dear for shewing it me,-166.657
 Part of my lace is gone said she and I do not know how I am to contrive,-175.725
 He continued,-27.789
 She was so surprized she did not know what to do,-90.104
 Her attention was now claimed by Mr Woodhouse who being according to his custom on such occasions making the circle of his guests and paying his particular compliments to the ladies was ending with her and with all his mildest urbanity said,-425.819
 They appear to so much advantage in company with each other,-110.419
 How much worse had they been obliged to meet,-98.644
 There he had not always the patience that could have been wished,-115.533
 Her connexions may be worse than his,-76.414
 You are a good woman he warmly replied,-82.01
 Did she know had she heard any thing about her since their being at Randalls he felt much anxiety he must confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably,-329.755
 The ladies had not been long in the drawing room before the other ladies in their different divisions arrived,-179.367
 Mrs Jennings knowing nothing of any change in the patient went unusually early to bed her maid who was one of the principal nurses was recreating herself in the housekeeper s room and Elinor remained alone with Marianne,-370.364
 She could not be too soon alarmed nor send for Perry too often,-131.569
 Even pleasure you know is fatiguing and I cannot say that any of them seemed very much to have enjoyed it,-187.798
 If you please my dear,-51.647
 Mr Elton and I are very good friends and nothing more and she walked on amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances of the mistakes which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into and not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant and in want of counsel,-658.653
 And with this pleasing anticipation she sat down to reconsider the past recall the words and endeavour to comprehend all the feelings of Edward and of course to reflect on her own with discontent,-334.604
 Make a civil message but I shall only leave my card,-123.017
 Lady Elliott wished to give a dance,-77.455
 Upon my word it is Miss Bates He really is engaged from morning to night There is no end of people s coming to him on some pretence or other The magistrates and overseers and churchwardens are always wanting his opinion,-399.458
 Design could never bring them in each other s way negligence could never leave them exposed to a surprise and chance had less in its favour in the crowd of London than even in the retirement of Barton where it might force him before her while paying that visit at Allenham on his marriage which Mrs Dashwood from foreseeing at first as a probable event had brought herself to expect as a certain one,-772.326
 To separate Edward and Elinor was as far from being her object as ever and she wished to show Mrs John Dashwood by this pointed invitation to her brother how totally she disregarded her disapprobation of the match,-386.141
 I have known her from a child undoubtedly we have been children and women together and it is natural to suppose that we should be intimate that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited her friends,-373.01
 End of volume one,-61.067
 Is she angry,-42.565
 I d rather you would,-56.163
 I cannot think there is any danger of it was Emma s calm answer and when you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax s situation and understand what her home has been with Colonel and Mrs Campbell I have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown,-470.825
 Mr Elton I must beg leave to stop at your house and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or string or any thing just to keep my boot on,-317.962
 Elinor saw and pitied her for the neglect of abilities which education might have rendered so respectable but she saw with less tenderness of feeling the thorough want of delicacy of rectitude and integrity of mind which her attentions her assiduities her flatteries at the Park betrayed and she could have no lasting satisfaction in the company of a person who joined insincerity with ignorance whose want of instruction prevented their meeting in conversation on terms of equality and whose conduct toward others made every shew of attention and deference towards herself perfectly valueless,-1001.739
 She must be collected and calm,-63.203
 He had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle his horror of late hours and large dinner parties made him unfit for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms,-384.076
 Captain Benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the Laconia and the account which Captain Wentworth had given of him on his return from Lyme before his warm praise of him as an excellent young man and an officer whom he had always valued highly which must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener had been followed by a little history of his private life which rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies,-792.487
 There was too much wind to make the high part of the new Cobb pleasant for the ladies and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower and all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight excepting Louisa she must be jumped down them by Captain Wentworth,-544.289
 there he is,-36.158
 Mary is good natured enough in many respects said she but she does sometimes provoke me excessively by her nonsense and pride the Elliot pride,-280.69
 The varieties of handwriting were farther talked of and the usual observations made,-147.377
 I owed it to her therefore to avoid giving any hint of the truth and I owed it to my family and friends not to create in them a solicitude about me which it could not be in my power to satisfy,-397.102
 We live at home quiet confined and our feelings prey upon us,-138.908
 This little circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before,-113.417
 It would not be likely to produce that dejection of mind which frequently attended him,-152.21
 She tried to dissuade Mary from going but in vain and that being the case thought it best to accept the Miss Musgroves much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise as she might be useful in turning back with her sister and lessening the interference in any plan of their own,-525.834
 Harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion,-104.983
 My Elinor is it possible to doubt their engagement,-98.674
 Did you see her often at Weymouth,-76.262
 Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own,-226.278
 With such a knowledge as this it was impossible for Elinor to feel easy on the subject,-160.328
 Well if you please said Mrs Weston rather hesitating if you think she will be of any use,-167.357
 The event was more favourable to Mr Woodhouse than to Emma,-110.58
 She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes in talking and listening and forming all these schemes in the in betweens that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate and the supper table which always closed such parties and for which she had been used to sit and watch the due time was all set out and ready and moved forwards to the fire before she was aware,-741.898
 I have not a doubt of it said Marianne and I have nothing to regret nothing but my own folly,-167.604
 To do what would be most generally pleasing must be our object if one could but tell what that would be,-216.188
 my dear sir how are you this morning,-85.026
 And you must be off this very morning,-77.608
 Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer and advised its being written directly which was agreed to in the hope of her assistance and though Emma continued to protest against any assistance being wanted it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence,-474.592
 Against the interest of her own individual comfort Mrs Dashwood had determined that it would be better for Marianne to be any where at that time than at Barton where every thing within her view would be bringing back the past in the strongest and most afflicting manner by constantly placing Willoughby before her such as she had always seen him there,-592.057
 He walked off to find his father but was quickly back again with both Mr and Mrs Weston,-178.499
 I have a note of his Do not you remember Mrs Weston employing him to write for you one day,-188.748
 Elinor tried to talk of something else but Miss Steele could not be kept beyond a couple of minutes from what was uppermost in her mind,-240.779
 Mrs Musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness for the play if Henrietta and all the others liked it when Mary eagerly interrupted her by exclaiming,-309.816
 Are no probabilities to be accepted merely because they are not certainties,-124.487
 No I have never seen Mr Elton she replied starting on this appeal is he is he a tall man,-202.83
 You know we have settled all that already,-83.792
 Her heart was really grieved,-59.843
 This has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed,-99.191
 What is Mr Elliot to me,-53.473
 She saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed her before,-126.339
 She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful girl which she trusted with such frequent meetings at Hartfield was foundation enough on his side and on Harriet s there could be little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual weight and efficacy,-514.338
 Not above ten miles I dare say,-80.804
 my poor dear child the truth is that in London it is always a sickly season,-168.968
 It will be some trial to us both,-80.445
 Such talent as hers must not be suffered to remain unknown I dare say you have heard those charming lines of the poet,-247.697
 About a mile and a half from the cottage along the narrow winding valley of Allenham which issued from that of Barton as formerly described the girls had in one of their earliest walks discovered an ancient respectable looking mansion which by reminding them a little of Norland interested their imagination and made them wish to be better acquainted with it,-662.101
 Emma could not have a better companion than Harriet,-81.607
 But sometimes of an evening before we went to cards he would read something aloud out of the Elegant Extracts very entertaining,-236.712
 Pretty well ma am in the fifteen years of my marriage though many women have done more,-188.586
 Merely Gowland he supposed,-55.685
 She has had the advantage you know of practising on me she continued like La Baronne d Almane on La Comtesse d Ostalis in Madame de Genlis Adelaide and Theodore and we shall now see her own little Adelaide educated on a more perfect plan,-432.244
 Be sure to give me intelligence of the letter as soon as possible,-122.307
 To be sure,-30.718
 She who had not been able to remain in Louisa s room or to look at her without sufferings which made her worse than helpless,-243.376
 He saw the necessity of inviting the Miss Steeles immediately and his conscience was pacified by the resolution of inviting his sisters another year at the same time however slyly suspecting that another year would make the invitation needless by bringing Elinor to town as Colonel Brandon s wife and Marianne as THEIR visitor,-549.297
 Time a very little time I tell him will do everything Marianne s heart is not to be wasted for ever on such a man as Willoughby His own merits must soon secure it,-344.263
 When one lives in the world a man or woman s marrying for money is too common to strike one as it ought,-246.397
 The old lady,-34.962
 Smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first glancing towards Miss Fairfax but it was most prudent to avoid speech,-226.938
 Elinor smiled again to hear her sister describing so accurately their future expenses at Combe Magna,-173.352
 He had met with them in a little perplexity which must be laid before Emma,-134.253
 She must not appear to think it a misfortune With all the spirits she could command she prepared him first for something strange and then in a few words said that if his consent and approbation could be obtained which she trusted would be attended with no difficulty since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all she and Mr Knightley meant to marry by which means Hartfield would receive the constant addition of that person s company whom she knew he loved next to his daughters and Mrs Weston best in the world,-940.07
 Emma why is it that they are your enemies,-87.762
 It was indeed so odd Harriet s behaviour was so extremely odd that Emma did not know how to understand it,-194.677
 Anne saw nothing thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room,-107.217
 The preparing and the going abroad in such weather with the sacrifice of his children after dinner were evils were disagreeables at least which Mr John Knightley did not by any means like he anticipated nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase and the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his discontent,-637.022
 said she my dear Ferrars do tell me how it is to be managed,-124.087
 I am going home and you have an engagement with your friend,-104.077
 There was no occasion to press the matter farther,-92.076
 Till he came and had examined the child their apprehensions were the worse for being vague they suspected great injury but knew not where but now the collar bone was soon replaced and though Mr Robinson felt and felt and rubbed and looked grave and spoke low words both to the father and the aunt still they were all to hope the best and to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind and then it was just before they parted that the two young aunts were able so far to digress from their nephew s state as to give the information of Captain Wentworth s visit staying five minutes behind their father and mother to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted they were with him how much handsomer how infinitely more agreeable they thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance who had been at all a favourite before,-1555.799
 She knew that when she played she was giving pleasure only to herself but this was no new sensation,-188.279
 The sitting was altogether very satisfactory she was quite enough pleased with the first day s sketch to wish to go on,-221.5
 He was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys clinging to him like an old friend and declaring he should not go and being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away in his coat pockets c to have another moment for finishing or recollecting what he had begun Anne was left to persuade herself as well as she could that the same brother must still be in question,-708.554
 Some letters had passed between her and her brother in consequence of Marianne s illness and in the first of John s there had been this sentence We know nothing of our unfortunate Edward and can make no enquiries on so prohibited a subject but conclude him to be still at Oxford which was all the intelligence of Edward afforded her by the correspondence for his name was not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters,-742.17
 Mrs Harville a degree less polished than her husband seemed however to have the same good feelings and nothing could be more pleasant than their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own because the friends of Captain Wentworth or more kindly hospitable than their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them,-588.333
 Your father will not be easy why do not you go,-108.585
 Always the first person to be thought of,-82.346
 I do not know One of the Otways Not Frank it is not Frank I assure you,-146.247
 Marianne now looking dreadfully white and unable to stand sunk into her chair and Elinor expecting every moment to see her faint tried to screen her from the observation of others while reviving her with lavender water,-403.797
 This is what I believe to have happened,-73.534
 But this is no excuse for their concealing it from us,-110.418
 You forget how much she belongs to Highbury,-88.422
 Jane Fairfax Good God,-47.057
 You wrong her exceedingly,-53.403
 Emma had never been to Box Hill she wished to see what every body found so well worth seeing and she and Mr Weston had agreed to chuse some fine morning and drive thither,-338.561
 But she was not wanted to speak,-58.665
 A few years before Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl but her bloom had vanished early and as even in its height her father had found little to admire in her so totally different were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own there could be nothing in them now that she was faded and thin to excite his esteem,-636.48
 As they were turning into the grounds Mr Perry passed by on horseback,-147.823
 I am no young lady on her preferment,-82.248
 He had come in his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill s engagement with no selfish view no view at all but of endeavouring if she allowed him an opening to soothe or to counsel her The rest had been the work of the moment the immediate effect of what he heard on his feelings,-569.449
 She could not be deceived in that,-58.783
 If you are very kind said he it will be one of the waltzes we danced last night let me live them over again,-222.174
 But with a reproachful smile at Emma she receives attentions from Mrs Elton which nobody else pays her,-185.42
 She had yet another reason for wishing her children to remain where they were a letter from her son in law had told her that he and his wife were to be in town before the middle of February and she judged it right that they should sometimes see their brother,-481.629
 They went through the particulars of their first meeting a great many times,-131.162
 cried Harriet colouring and astonished,-68.432
 You do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men,-127.504
 When Lucy first came to Barton Park last November she told me in confidence of her engagement,-180.276
 I must hurry away then to give him those thanks which you will not allow me to give YOU to assure him that he has made me a very an exceedingly happy man,-312.073
 Are not you astonished,-54.942
 he had never written hardly ever any thing of the kind in his life,-129.377
 She listened to her praise of Lucy with only moving from one chair to another and when Mrs Jennings talked of Edward s affection it cost her only a spasm in her throat Such advances towards heroism in her sister made Elinor feel equal to any thing herself,-469.057
 He seems to have a calm decided temper not at all open to dangerous impressions,-160.738
 Musgrove take care of the others,-61.323
 In general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their mornings but one complete dinner engagement and out of the house too there was no avoiding though at Christmas,-320.77
 You know Mrs Weston you and I must be cautious how we express ourselves,-138.697
 But when you mentioned Mrs Dixon I felt how much more probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship,-226.581
 Her way was clear though not quite smooth She spoke then on being so entreated What did she say Just what she ought of course,-280.935
 I mean said he with serious energy if I can to make you hate me one degree less than you do NOW,-227.932
 It would be a crowd a sad crowd and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in,-204.317
 I think Miss Woodhouse you and I must establish a musical club and have regular weekly meetings at your house or ours,-234.568
 In respectability of character there can be no doubt that they are,-117.368
 About a fortnight,-41.438
 We never were so long without seeing her before and as I was telling Mrs Cole we shall hardly know how to make enough of her now,-257.527
 no,-18.253
 I mean to offer some kind of explanation some kind of apology for the past to open my whole heart to you and by convincing you that though I have been always a blockhead I have not been always a rascal to obtain something like forgiveness from Ma from your sister,-510.262
 Anne gave her credit indeed for feelings of great consideration towards herself in all that related to Kellynch and it pleased her especially as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute in the instant even of introduction that there was not the smallest symptom of any knowledge or suspicion on Mrs Croft s side to give a bias of any sort,-643.051
 Elton s absence just at this time was the very thing to be desired,-136.652
 You were a good while at Lyme I think,-91.716
 I found said he that I was considered by Harville an engaged man,-134.55
 Two months must bring it to the proof,-91.012
 At these words Marianne s eyes expressed the astonishment which her lips could not utter,-170.292
 You may say what you chuse but your countenance testifies that your thoughts on this subject are very much like mine,-217.681
 He immediately went into the passage opened the front door and ushered her in himself,-165.815
 Her mother sisters Fanny all had been conscious of his regard for her at Norland it was not an illusion of her own vanity,-215.709
 I who am owing all my happiness to you would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be severe on them,-216.984
 was repeated by Marianne and her mother in an accent of the utmost amazement and though Elinor could not speak even HER eyes were fixed on him with the same impatient wonder,-317.398
 In this state of schemes and hopes and connivance June opened upon Hartfield,-146.409
 I shall be at home in twenty minutes,-75.49
 She was ready to tell every thing in her power but on this subject questions were vain,-163.644
 The girls looked all amazement,-65.226
 I saw them turn the corner from Bath Street just now,-124.67
 Shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or other,-145.396
 in places you see it is dreadfully dirty and the wainscot is more yellow and forlorn than any thing I could have imagined,-232.074
 And then rising she went away to join Marianne whom she found as she expected in her own room leaning in silent misery over the small remains of a fire which till Elinor s entrance had been her only light,-417.469
 Much much beyond impropriety It has sunk him I cannot say how it has sunk him in my opinion,-201.297
 It raises my influence much too high the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is too much for an indifferent person,-258.11
 He began with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick chamber again for the present to entreat her to promise him not to venture into such hazard till he had seen Mr Perry and learnt his opinion and though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its proper course there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her,-718.419
 Well my dear said Mrs Jennings and how did you travel,-106.634
 I hardly ever get a letter,-63.246
 Miss Elliot do you remember our walking together at Lyme and grieving for him,-145.009
 Let me know what you think of this,-73.005
 She heard of her walking with the Eltons sitting with the Eltons spending a day with the Eltons,-176.792
 Nothing but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future,-182.894
 Never in her life had Elinor found it so difficult to be calm as at that moment,-173.573
 Jealousy of Mr Elliot had been the retarding weight the doubt the torment,-125.917
 Elinor had given her real opinion to her sister,-81.877
 That young man speaking lower is very thoughtless,-94.759
 had it by any blessed felicity occurred to her to institute the comparison She saw that there never had been a time when she did not consider Mr Knightley as infinitely the superior or when his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear,-428.885
 I like a fine prospect but not on picturesque principles,-108.917
 Every moment rather brought fresh agitation,-80.763
 So they will my dear,-55.926
 She exclaimed however with a very tolerable imitation of nature,-102.691
 But I want to set your heart at ease as to Mrs S My representation you see has quite appeased her,-220.73
 I declare sometimes I do not know which way to look before them,-119.175
 In a long strip of meadow land where there was ample space for all they were thus divided forming three distinct parties and to that party of the three which boasted least animation and least complaisance Anne necessarily belonged,-428.57
 It was but a passing emotion however with Mrs Smith she shook it off and soon added in a different tone,-216.136
 Elinor remembered what Robert had told her in Harley Street of his opinion of what his own mediation in his brother s affairs might have done if applied to in time,-299.902
 Colonel Brandon is certainly younger than Mrs Jennings but he is old enough to be MY father and if he were ever animated enough to be in love must have long outlived every sensation of the kind,-345.703
 They had the pleasure of assuring her that Bath more than answered their expectations in every respect,-176.25
 Well said I all I can say is that if this be true he has used a young lady of my acquaintance abominably ill and I wish with all my soul his wife may plague his heart out,-377.373
 Colonel Brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability,-110.816
 The party drove off in very good spirits Sir Walter prepared with condescending bows for all the afflicted tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show themselves and Anne walked up at the same time in a sort of desolate tranquillity to the Lodge where she was to spend the first week,-518.404
 But you shall hear it all When I got to Mr Palmer s I found Charlotte quite in a fuss about the child,-218.817
 There is always a look of consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be beneath them,-220.034
 She regained the street happy in this that though much had been forced on her against her will though she had in fact heard the whole substance of Jane Fairfax s letter she had been able to escape the letter itself,-385.087
 Well well ladies are the best judges but James Benwick is rather too piano for me and though very likely it is all our partiality Sophy and I cannot help thinking Frederick s manners better than his,-379.284
 Within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge ware box which Harriet opened it was well lined with the softest cotton but excepting the cotton Emma saw only a small piece of court plaister,-368.199
 He is turning away,-43.778
 She was afterwards looking for her shawl Frank Churchill was looking also it was growing dusk and the room was in confusion and how they parted Mr Knightley could not tell,-290.597
 His civilities to the other ladies must be paid but his subsequent object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering and the walk he had had for nothing,-323.634
 Here Mrs Smith paused a moment but Anne had not a word to say and she continued,-157.847
 Thank ye the gloves do very well only a little too large about the wrist but Jane is taking them in,-220.739
 There was at times a want of spirits about him which if it did not denote indifference spoke of something almost as unpromising,-220.534
 She paused Her daughter could not quite agree with her but her dissent was not heard and therefore gave no offence,-202.148
 He could meet even Lady Russell in a discussion of her merits and Anne could not be given to understand so much by her friend could not know herself to be so highly rated by a sensible man without many of those agreeable sensations which her friend meant to create,-474.323
 If you think he will come I shall think so too for you know Enscombe,-145.129
 Emma accepted it with a very eager hand with an impatience all alive to know what he would say about it and not at all checked by hearing that her friend was unmentioned,-312.355
 Man s boasted power and freedom all are flown Lord of the earth and sea he bends a slave And woman lovely woman reigns alone,-285.39
 In half a minute Charles was at the bottom of Union Street again and the other two proceeding together and soon words enough had passed between them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet and retired gravel walk where the power of conversation would make the present hour a blessing indeed and prepare it for all the immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives could bestow,-732.673
 The second day brought them into the cherished or the prohibited county of Somerset for as such was it dwelt on by turns in Marianne s imagination and in the forenoon of the third they drove up to Cleveland,-384.547
 He came down by yesterday s coach and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast to report his proceedings first on my affairs and then on his own,-300.6
 and that s so dreadful,-60.198
 I had none,-31.102
 Elizabeth had turned from him Lady Russell overlooked him her nerves were strengthened by these circumstances she felt that she owed him attention,-246.341
 No not immediately here,-46.758
 He soon joined them again successful of course Lady Dalrymple would be most happy to take them home and would call for them in a few minutes,-255.939
 Little had Mrs Dashwood or her daughters imagined when they first came into Devonshire that so many engagements would arise to occupy their time as shortly presented themselves or that they should have such frequent invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them little leisure for serious employment,-536.121
 How the long stage would pass how it was to affect their manners what was to be their sort of intercourse she could not foresee,-254.421
 A fine place but very retired,-75.354
 I may not have convinced you perhaps but I am perfectly convinced myself that Mr Dixon is a principal in the business,-206.078
 I do not mean to justify myself but at the same time cannot leave you to suppose that I have nothing to urge that because she was injured she was irreproachable and because I was a libertine SHE must be a saint,-356.598
 If Miss Woodhouse would not be displeased she would rather stay at home,-120.126
 The Miss Dashwoods had no greater reason to be dissatisfied with Mrs Jennings s style of living and set of acquaintance than with her behaviour to themselves which was invariably kind,-302.024
 And books Thomson Cowper Scott she would buy them all over and over again she would buy up every copy I believe to prevent their falling into unworthy hands and she would have every book that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree,-489.332
 They walked off followed in half a minute by Mr Knightley,-111.013
 But ah,-22.109
 The shame he answered is all mine or ought to be,-117.54
 my sins my sins And I had plenty all the while in my pocket One of my senseless tricks I deserve to be under a continual blush all the rest of my life Well sitting down again go on what else,-413.021
 Nobody doubts it and I hope you do not think I am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and pleasures as myself,-264.135
 She gave a moment s recollection as they hurried along to the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed earlier in the morning,-234.967
 She hoped no one could have said to her How could you be so unfeeling to your father I must I will tell you truths while I can,-263.434
 Lady Middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all the year round while Sir John s independent employments were in existence only half the time,-291.425
 His age is only so much beyond hers as to be an advantage as to make his character and principles fixed and his disposition I am well convinced is exactly the very one to make your sister happy,-375.95
 Nonsense,-24.329
 Oh no as to leaving the little boy both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm to bear the thought and Anne in the joy of the escape could not help adding her warm protestations to theirs,-430.129
 He is not at all a well bred young man,-87.452
 He told me every thing his circumstances and plans and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage,-207.624
 The intelligence which had been so anxiously announced to her she was now to be anxiously announcing to another,-179.877
 Her insipidity was invariable for even her spirits were always the same and though she did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband provided every thing were conducted in style and her two eldest children attended her she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she might have experienced in sitting at home and so little did her presence add to the pleasure of the others by any share in their conversation that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys,-940.477
 She was first called to observe and approve him farther by a reflection which Elinor chanced one day to make on the difference between him and his sister,-282.146
 Edward was the first to speak and it was to notice Marianne s altered looks and express his fear of her not finding London agree with her,-261.246
 It did assist for though he began with grave looks and short questions he was soon led on to talk of them all in the usual way and to take the child out of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity,-397.248
 for shame,-32.414
 The others will be here presently,-66.269
 That is what I like that is what a young man ought to be,-120.57
 Elinor had met his eye and looked conscious likewise,-102.108
 But here you are in Bath and the object is to be established here with all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to Sir Walter Elliot,-265.05
 Seldom very seldom does complete truth belong to any human disclosure seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised or a little mistaken but where as in this case though the conduct is mistaken the feelings are not it may not be very material Mr Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart than she possessed or a heart more disposed to accept of his,-704.522
 Mr Elliot had called repeatedly had dined with them once evidently delighted by the distinction of being asked for they gave no dinners in general delighted in short by every proof of cousinly notice and placing his whole happiness in being on intimate terms in Camden Place,-505.309
 Mr and Mrs Musgrove cannot think it wrong while I remain with him,-126.637
 What she was must be uncertain but who she was might be found out and setting aside the 10 000 l it did not appear that she was at all Harriet s superior,-313.416
 I should never be out if they were all Sophys or something of that sort,-132.804
 I think her the very worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have,-136.335
 It appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature,-113.907
 Charles is out shooting,-55.385
 It was her very particular friend you know,-72.3
 I would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible,-120.695
 I am afraid there had been some mistake and I wish you particularly to assure Captain Harville and Captain Wentworth that we hope to see them both,-245.621
 And as to my poor word success which you quarrel with I do not know that I am so entirely without any claim to it,-224.459
 He had in fact though his sisters were now doing all they could for him by calling him poor Richard been nothing better than a thick headed unfeeling unprofitable Dick Musgrove who had never done anything to entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name living or dead,-501.611
 He got up and moved away,-65.429
 Mrs Jennings however assured him directly that she should not stand upon ceremony for they were all cousins or something like it and she should certainly wait on Mrs John Dashwood very soon and bring her sisters to see her,-382.097
 Nay the longer they were together the more doubtful seemed the nature of his regard and sometimes for a few painful minutes she believed it to be no more than friendship,-305.678
 She was a benevolent charitable good woman and capable of strong attachments most correct in her conduct strict in her notions of decorum and with manners that were held a standard of good breeding,-372.511
 She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith s conversation but she found her altogether very engaging not inconveniently shy not unwilling to talk and yet so far from pushing shewing so proper and becoming a deference seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to Hartfield and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to that she must have good sense and deserve encouragement,-800.696
 My brother and sister will be enchanted with this place,-95.068
 I should like it of all things was not plainer in words than manner,-134.433
 Colonel Brandon give ME a living Can it be possible,-113.894
 Don t you Mr,-46.655
 I am not saying that she did not err in her advice,-100.21
 You must not talk so Marianne,-61.655
 Its character as a ball room caught him and instead of passing on he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed windows which were open to look in and contemplate its capabilities and lament that its original purpose should have ceased,-481.874
 A bowing acquaintance,-39.131
 Elton,-17.806
 This present from the Campbells said she this pianoforte is very kindly given,-140.464
 You must take care of yourself Mrs,-70.98
 With a hasty exclamation of Misery and a sign to her sister not to follow her she directly got up and hurried out of the room,-249.476
 And take it altogether now that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge there is not one that we like better than this,-286.026
 What is before me I see,-63.488
 His quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy expression and even when he might have determined not to look she was confident that he was often listening,-335.144
 No one made any objection but Marianne who with her usual inattention to the forms of general civility exclaimed Your Ladyship will have the goodness to excuse ME you know I detest cards,-358.784
 She observed in a low voice to her mother that they were probably going down to Mr Pratt s near Plymouth,-206.345
 I wonder what it can be,-55.827
 You are afraid of giving me trouble but I assure you my dear Jane the Campbells can hardly be more interested about you than I am,-250.26
 We must go for the Westons come to us next week you know,-126.172
 But suspicion of something unpleasant is the inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessed in him,-204.193
 I always regret excessively on dear Emma s account that she cannot be more at Highbury but now their daughter is married I suppose Colonel and Mrs Campbell will not be able to part with her at all,-356.154
 This set the matter beyond a doubt,-80.011
 Do let me hear what she says,-78.727
 It would not be fair and yet you ought to have proof for what is all this but assertion and you shall have proof,-229.349
 Emma scarcely heard what was said Her mind was divided between two ideas her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax and poor Harriet and for some time she could only exclaim and require confirmation repeated confirmation,-394.256
 Poor Edward,-27.293
 She then broke the lace off short and dexterously throwing it into a ditch was presently obliged to entreat them to stop and acknowledged her inability to put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort,-423.989
 I think on the contrary when people shut themselves up entirely from society it is a very bad thing and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in a proper degree without living in it either too much or too little,-426.197
 Our part of London is very superior to most others You must not confound us with London in general my dear sir,-233.054
 Nothing wanting,-31.87
 But instead of having any thing to do instead of having any profession chosen for me or being allowed to chuse any myself I returned home to be completely idle and for the first twelvemonth afterwards I had not even the nominal employment which belonging to the university would have given me for I was not entered at Oxford till I was nineteen,-597.531
 Yes a great while ever since my sister married He was a particular friend of Sir John s,-171.455
 Dear Emma bears every thing so well said her father,-104.402
 There is something so shocking in a child s being taken away from his parents and natural home,-190.516
 I met the letters in my way this morning and seeing my son s hand presumed to open it though it was not directed to me it was to Mrs Weston,-297.104
 Ay that we shall,-49.005
 The possibility of the young man s coming to Mrs Goddard s that morning and meeting with Harriet and pleading his own cause gave alarming ideas,-245.542
 Was it impossible No Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in understanding but he had been very much struck with the loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner and all the probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour For Harriet it would be advantageous and delightful indeed,-536.227
 Captain Benwick came not however,-61.75
 You must promise me not to sit up,-82.878
 Certainly he is not like Mr Knightley,-64.417
 Mr Elton was only too happy,-55.615
 You and I Emma will venture to take the part of the poor husband,-132.969
 Elinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention in her power and she would have tried to sooth and tranquilize her still more had not Marianne entreated her with all the eagerness of the most nervous irritability not to speak to her for the world,-403.781
 Fanny rejoicing in her escape and proud of the ready wit that had procured it wrote the next morning to Lucy to request her company and her sister s for some days in Harley Street as soon as Lady Middleton could spare them,-440.044
 I do not believe said Mrs Dashwood with a good humoured smile that Mr Willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of MY daughters towards what you call CATCHING him,-305.707
 Anne found Captain Benwick again drawing near her,-87.932
 He was often hoping intending to come but was always prevented,-119.253
 Pain is no expiation,-36.126
 A whole evening of back gammon with her father was felicity to it,-129.648
 She is very timid and silent,-53.403
 My dear Jane say no more about it,-73.682
 It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell but she really did not seem to feel it,-147.624
 Thank you said he in an accent of deep mortification and not another syllable followed,-166.17
 Our ages were nearly the same and from our earliest years we were playfellows and friends,-175.21
 I certainly do forget to think of her said Emma as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend,-214.388
 Marianne sighed out her similar apprehension and Elinor s heart wrung for the feelings of Edward while braving his mother s threats for a woman who could not reward him,-279.278
 And in short she said more than her husband could long withstand and as none of the others could oppose when he gave way there was no help for it the change of Mary for Anne was inevitable,-380.746
 Their attention and wit were drawn off to his more fortunate rival and the raillery which the other had incurred before any partiality arose was removed when his feelings began really to call for the ridicule so justly annexed to sensibility,-453.674
 The peace turned him on shore at the very moment and he has been living with us in our little family circle ever since,-243.962
 There are not many men who would act as he has done,-118.996
 We are not boy and girl to be captiously irritable misled by every moment s inadvertence and wantonly playing with our own happiness,-229.128
 As they approached Barton indeed and entered on scenes of which every field and every tree brought some peculiar some painful recollection she grew silent and thoughtful and turning away her face from their notice sat earnestly gazing through the window,-477.337
 She must have found the evening agreeable Mr Knightley because she had Emma,-122.238
 Are you acquainted with Mr Robert Ferrars,-75.928
 Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas and hoped by the help of backgammon to get her father tolerably through the evening and be attacked by no regrets but her own,-378.016
 My love you contradict every body said his wife with her usual laugh,-140.341
 He writes like a sensible man replied Emma when she had read the letter,-142.555
 Such kind friends you know Miss Woodhouse one must always find agreeable though every body seemed rather fagged after the morning s party,-241.463
 No intercourse with Harriet possible but by note no church for her on Sunday any more than on Christmas Day and no need to find excuses for Mr Elton s absenting himself,-335.741
 It would have been beyond comparison she said the least evil of the two and she would be glad to compound NOW for nothing worse,-223.972
 A lady without a family was the very best preserver of furniture in the world,-141.013
 You can make little Charles do anything he always minds you at a word,-153.804
 No I thank you no certainly not,-72.773
 In spite of the mischief of his attentions she owed him gratitude and regard perhaps compassion,-173.579
 Take care Margaret,-48.661
 And Mrs Perry and the children how are they,-97.588
 We ought to be acquainted with Enscombe and with Mrs Churchill s temper before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do,-242.656
 By his description a good deal like the second size double barrel of mine which you shot with one day round Winthrop,-244.909
 Her manners were by no means so elegant as her sister s but they were much more prepossessing,-162.874
 I am sure of having their opinions with me,-79.091
 Mr Palmer is so droll,-54.191
 We want only two more to be just the right number,-117.815
 Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell,-105.438
 This very awkward history of Mr Elliot was still after an interval of several years felt with anger by Elizabeth who had liked the man for himself and still more for being her father s heir and whose strong family pride could see only in him a proper match for Sir Walter Elliot s eldest daughter,-581.591
 The charm of Kellynch and of Lady Elliot all faded away,-111.39
 I wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it,-122.696
 She paused and added in a low voice If I could but know HIS heart everything would become easy,-204.678
 It is fit that the fortune should be on his side for I think the merit will be all on hers,-202.028
 You must be very much altered indeed since we parted if that could be the case and you not there,-188.698
 Was he at all such as he appears now,-94.298
 But if he marries a very ignorant vulgar woman certainly I had better not visit her if I can help it,-214.471
 It was not lost on me,-52.956
 There was no bearing such an always and to break through her dreadful gratitude Emma made the direct inquiry of,-221.284
 and by the means of this continual though gentle vent was able not only to see the Miss Dashwoods from the first without the smallest emotion but very soon to see them without recollecting a word of the matter and having thus supported the dignity of her own sex and spoken her decided censure of what was wrong in the other she thought herself at liberty to attend to the interest of her own assemblies and therefore determined though rather against the opinion of Sir John that as Mrs Willoughby would at once be a woman of elegance and fortune to leave her card with her as soon as she married,-1054.683
 The case you see is but this is quite between ourselves I did not mention a syllable of it in the other room,-214.484
 No sir she replied with firmness I shall NOT stay,-114.247
 I am sure William Larkins will not like it,-75.236
 Disappointed however and vexed as she was and sometimes displeased with his uncertain behaviour to herself she was very well disposed on the whole to regard his actions with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications which had been rather more painfully extorted from her for Willoughby s service by her mother,-491.798
 But he talked of flannel waistcoats said Marianne and with me a flannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches cramps rheumatisms and every species of ailment that can afflict the old and the feeble,-301.144
 I wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour,-108.62
 Mrs Dashwood smiled and said nothing,-59.97
 I could not go away you know because of the rain but I did so wish myself anywhere in the world but there Oh,-221.863
 said Anne suddenly struck by an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging,-164.075
 But he was careless and immethodical like other men about those things and when I came to examine his papers I found it with others still more trivial from different people scattered here and there while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed,-487.619
 He was invited on good faith,-71.198
 Mrs Jennings who had been inclined from the first to think Marianne s complaint more serious than Elinor now looked very grave on Mr Harris s report and confirming Charlotte s fears and caution urged the necessity of her immediate removal with her infant and Mr Palmer though treating their apprehensions as idle found the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great to be withstood,-659.739
 She wanted to hear much more than Mary had communicated,-101.019
 I have crossed the Atlantic four times and have been once to the East Indies and back again and only once besides being in different places about home Cork and Lisbon and Gibraltar,-332.331
 They could not listen to her description of him,-83.47
 How she should begin how she should express herself in her note to Edward was now all her concern,-196.862
 Churchill s state however as many were ready to remind her was liable to such sudden variation as might disappoint her nephew in the most reasonable dependence and Mrs Weston was at last persuaded to believe or to say that it must be by some attack of Mrs Churchill that he was prevented coming Emma looked at Harriet while the point was under consideration she behaved very well and betrayed no emotion,-734.978
 I see her instrument is open,-67.827
 She saw nothing of the Willoughbys nothing of Edward and for some time nothing of anybody who could by any chance whether grave or gay be interesting to her,-273.629
 Lord,-18.503
 As Harriet described it there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour,-213.183
 And your mother has brought on herself a most appropriate punishment,-119.372
 How they could be thrown together and by what attraction Robert could be drawn on to marry a girl of whose beauty she had herself heard him speak without any admiration a girl too already engaged to his brother and on whose account that brother had been thrown off by his family it was beyond her comprehension to make out,-608.13
 Mamma how shall we do without her,-77.459
 His heart was softened in seeing mine suffer and so much of his ill will was done away that when we parted he almost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an old promise about a pointer puppy,-430.526
 Irish I dare say,-48.394
 Your feelings are singular,-44.921
 I suppose however on recollection that the case may probably be THIS,-134.046
 Though aware before she began it that it must bring a confession of his inconstancy and confirm their separation for ever she was not aware that such language could be suffered to announce it nor could she have supposed Willoughby capable of departing so far from the appearance of every honourable and delicate feeling so far from the common decorum of a gentleman as to send a letter so impudently cruel a letter which instead of bringing with his desire of a release any professions of regret acknowledged no breach of faith denied all peculiar affection whatever a letter of which every line was an insult and which proclaimed its writer to be deep in hardened villainy,-1229.242
 It was almost enough to spread purification and perfume all the way,-102.45
 My esteem for your whole family is very sincere but if I have been so unfortunate as to give rise to a belief of more than I felt or meant to express I shall reproach myself for not having been more guarded in my professions of that esteem,-474.487
 At last we are alone,-58.926
 Yes simpleton as I was but I am quite ashamed of it now and wish I could forget as easily as I can burn them,-229.802
 But I have not known him long and he is not a man I think to be known intimately soon,-174.165
 How can you think of dirt with such objects before you,-111.913
 There was intimacy between them and Mr Cole had heard from Mr Elton since his going away,-160.224
 I perfectly understand Mr Robinson s directions and have no fears and indeed Mary I cannot wonder at your husband,-210.857
 Her sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless,-96.653
 When one is in great pain you know one cannot feel any blessing quite as it may deserve,-188.899
 Behold him there the monarch of the seas,-95.491
 She asked no more questions therefore merely employed her own fancy and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money concern something just come to light of a disagreeable nature in the circumstances of the family something which the late event at Richmond had brought forward,-530.363
 In the course of a second visit she talked with great openness and Anne s astonishment increased,-174.086
 It did not surprise but it grieved Anne to observe that Elizabeth would not know him,-153.634
 My interference was quite as likely to do harm as good,-111.965
 There were three others Jane says which they hesitated about some time,-137.574
 said he,-22.841
 It is so cold so very cold and looks and feels so very much like snow that if it were to any other place or with any other party I should really try not to go out to day and dissuade my father from venturing but as he has made up his mind and does not seem to feel the cold himself I do not like to interfere as I know it would be so great a disappointment to Mr and Mrs Weston,-763.469
 This is three times as large And you have never any odd humours my dear,-160.826
 I always think that no mutual,-64.85
 Think then what I must have endured in hearing it bandied between the Eltons with all the vulgarity of needless repetition and all the insolence of imaginary superiority,-284.579
 said I it is Miss Woodhouse I am sure you will like to see her,-117.363
 yes and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance,-88.383
 It is certainly an unpleasant thing replied Mr Dashwood to have those kind of yearly drains on one s income,-209.381
 my dear but so much as Patty has to do And it is a kindness to employ our men,-190.248
 With insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every body s feelings with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every body s destiny,-261.128
 I have only to add my dear Willoughby that at Barton cottage you will always be welcome for I will not press you to return here immediately because you only can judge how far THAT might be pleasing to Mrs Smith and on this head I shall be no more disposed to question your judgment than to doubt your inclination,-602.956
 A surgeon,-32.16
 The dinner was a grand one the servants were numerous and every thing bespoke the Mistress s inclination for show and the Master s ability to support it,-280.775
 It was no longer in Emma s power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures,-149.706
 Have a little mercy on the poor men,-89.502
 Whenever I looked towards the past I saw some duty neglected or some failing indulged,-181.505
 I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy said Mr Knightley presently though I have kept my thoughts to myself but I now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet,-315.772
 She believed he was reckoned a very fine young man,-90.54
 It was not in her nature,-49.584
 you forget yourself you take me for my friend any message to Miss Smith I shall be happy to deliver but no more of this to me if you please,-283.671
 You saw her answer you wrote her answer too,-104.736
 Charles Musgrove was civil and agreeable in sense and temper he was undoubtedly superior to his wife but not of powers or conversation or grace to make the past as they were connected together at all a dangerous contemplation though at the same time Anne could believe with Lady Russell that a more equal match might have greatly improved him and that a woman of real understanding might have given more consequence to his character and more usefulness rationality and elegance to his habits and pursuits,-866.119
 He very handsomely hopes they will be happy together and there is nothing very unforgiving in that I think,-169.92
 cried Mrs Jennings I am sure he should be very welcome to bed and board at my house and so I would tell him if I could see him,-257.233
 I do not pretend to be a wit,-68.42
 Her Bath habits made evening parties perfectly natural to her and Maple Grove had given her a taste for dinners,-220.534
 No said he smiling that is no subject of regret at all,-117.064
 His attentive deference to her father contrasted with his former language was odious and when she thought of his cruel conduct towards Mrs Smith she could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness or the sound of his artificial good sentiments,-448.137
 He was proud of his conquest proud of tricking Edward and very proud of marrying privately without his mother s consent,-214.986
 And what inclines one less to bear she has no fair pretence of family or blood,-183.503
 True sir and Emma because she had Miss Fairfax,-95.204
 What can it possibly be,-58.112
 When is she dejected or melancholy,-69.261
 He dared not come to Bartlett s Buildings for fear of detection and though their mutual impatience to meet was not to be told they could do nothing at present but write,-307.484
 I am sure a month ago I had no more idea myself The strangest things do take place,-178.041
 Between these two she could want no possible attendance by day or night,-153.633
 To youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma s though under temporary gloom at night the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of spirits,-304.191
 Pray say no more,-44.948
 It was a gentleman it was Colonel Brandon himself,-78.317
 She had heard nothing of him since her leaving London nothing new of his plans nothing certain even of his present abode,-230.709
 And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess I pity you I thought you cleverer for depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck,-326.553
 It is what we happily have never known any thing of but it must be a life of misery,-175.755
 He liked very much to have his friends come and see him and from various united causes from his long residence at Hartfield and his good nature from his fortune his house and his daughter he could command the visits of his own little circle in a great measure as he liked,-505.943
 By his own marriage likewise which happened soon afterwards he added to his wealth,-159.202
 After clearing his throat however he proceeded thus,-103.492
 You do not go to town on horseback do you,-92.904
 how do you think I can live poking by myself I who have been always used till this winter to have Charlotte with me,-234.038
 She wished however to see the Crofts and was glad to be within when the visit was returned,-170.482
 I think Edward said Mrs Dashwood as they were at breakfast the last morning you would be a happier man if you had any profession to engage your time and give an interest to your plans and actions,-371.543
 I am sorry to find my love that my father does not think you looking well but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued,-241.297
 Her kind compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow sick and reduced seemed to have quite delighted Mr Elliot,-199.18
 This was broken by Willoughby who said with a faint smile It is folly to linger in this manner,-201.507
 If it would be good to her I am sure it would be evil to himself a very shameful and degrading connexion,-201.555
 one never thinks of married men s being beaux they have something else to do,-166.582
 By doing it I shall feel that I am near you,-108.081
 Choice how do you mean,-51.543
 He could hardly suppose I should neglect them,-80.055
 Mrs Ferrars not aware of their being Elinor s work particularly requested to look at them and after they had received gratifying testimony of Lady Middletons s approbation Fanny presented them to her mother considerately informing her at the same time that they were done by Miss Dashwood,-459.609
 The only way of proving it however will be to turn to our maps,-144.217
 They were a couple worth looking at,-77.34
 It will do you good to speak of your distress whatever it may be,-130.882
 and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things,-123.171
 How well you put it on so gratified,-95.786
 For my companion tells me said she that I absolutely promised Miss Bates last night that I would come this morning,-210.317
 This was very wonderful if it were true and Lady Russell was in a state of very agreeable curiosity and perplexity about Mr Elliot already recanting the sentiment she had so lately expressed to Mary of his being a man whom she had no wish to see,-439.841
 However I have determined I think I am right I think you ought to be made acquainted with Mr Elliot s real character,-205.013
 But you should tell them of the letter my dear said her father,-121.176
 I felt that she was infinitely dearer to me than any other woman in the world and that I was using her infamously,-193.412
 She felt that in quitting Donwell he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits that in living constantly with her father and in no house of his own there would be much very much to be borne with,-398.957
 How many days was it my dear between the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together in our lodgings at North Yarmouth,-261.924
 My greatest danger perhaps in housekeeping may be quite the other way in doing too much and being too careless of expense,-240.648
 Courtship a very good hint,-49.781
 He coloured and stammered out an unintelligible reply,-85.531
 CHAPTER 28,-20.766
 after taking her all over Allenham House and fixing on the very rooms they were to live in hereafter,-206.881
 Two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the over throw of every thing,-166.689
 He stopt a moment for recollection and then with another sigh went on,-140.368
 With difficulty however could she prevent her from following him herself and to persuade her to check her agitation to wait at least with the appearance of composure till she might speak to him with more privacy and more effect was impossible for Marianne continued incessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery of her feelings by exclamations of wretchedness,-622.272
 But Mr Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits not at all to confuse his intellects,-175.512
 She felt the loss of Willoughby s character yet more heavily than she had felt the loss of his heart his seduction and desertion of Miss Williams the misery of that poor girl and the doubt of what his designs might ONCE have been on herself preyed altogether so much on her spirits that she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt even to Elinor and brooding over her sorrows in silence gave more pain to her sister than could have been communicated by the most open and most frequent confession of them,-886.486
 If you prefer Mr Martin to every other person if you think him the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with why should you hesitate,-279.18
 The news of his cousins Anne s engagement burst on Mr Elliot most unexpectedly,-150.195
 Edward is very amiable and I love him tenderly,-98.736
 Mr Woodhouse came in and very soon led to the subject again by the recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of Well my dears how does your book go on Have you got any thing fresh,-366.472
 I hope you will be a great deal at Combe Magna,-90.625
 Lady Russell felt this break up of the family exceedingly,-109.453
 On HER measures depended those of her two friends Mrs Jennings could not quit Cleveland during the Dashwoods stay and Colonel Brandon was soon brought by their united request to consider his own abode there as equally determinate if not equally indispensable,-453.6
 He would be as little incumbrance as possible to Captain and Mrs Harville but as to leaving his sister in such a state he neither ought nor would,-264.328
 Can you be,-36.342
 After an hour or two spent in what her mother called comfortable chat or in other words in every variety of inquiry concerning all their acquaintance on Mrs Jennings s side and in laughter without cause on Mrs Palmer s it was proposed by the latter that they should all accompany her to some shops where she had business that morning to which Mrs Jennings and Elinor readily consented as having likewise some purchases to make themselves and Marianne though declining it at first was induced to go likewise,-899.105
 I hardly looked at him I was looking at the horses but I think he had something of the Elliot countenance I wonder the arms did not strike me,-271.686
 I always say we are quite blessed in our neighbours My dear sir if there is one thing my mother loves better than another it is pork a roast loin of pork,-340.739
 Perhaps indifferent if indifference could exist under such circumstances,-115.153
 She was good enough for Mr Elton no doubt accomplished enough for Highbury handsome enough to look plain probably by Harriet s side,-223.372
 Mrs Weston capital in her country dances was seated and beginning an irresistible waltz and Frank Churchill coming up with most becoming gallantry to Emma had secured her hand and led her up to the top,-381.074
 Well pretty good news is not it,-73.864
 His father was rendered easy by such an assurance and Mr John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there might prudently be in his power to do for them,-304.97
 CHAPTER VIII,-29.909
 Mr Weston had accompanied her to Mrs Bates s and gone through his share of this essential attention most handsomely but she having then induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing was now returned with much more to say and much more to say with satisfaction than a quarter of an hour spent in Mrs Bates s parlour with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings could have afforded,-692.334
 Emma could not but feel all this and then her face her features there was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered it was not regular but it was very pleasing beauty,-325.233
 Even if he did not come to Camden Place himself it would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence by Captain Harville,-228.133
 Men are very safe with us let them be ever so rich,-139.667
 She could have made an inquiry or two as to the expedition and the expense of the Irish mails it was at her tongue s end but she abstained,-246.392
 But perhaps he may never have heard of there being such a creature in the world,-144.755
 Though WE have not known him long he is no stranger in this part of the world and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage,-254.903
 He understood that she was in need of a dwelling and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage he assured her that everything should be done to it which she might think necessary if the situation pleased her,-415.534
 All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject but I believed none of it,-163.791
 He was here only a quarter of an hour and in a state of agitation which did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay but that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said,-350.02
 You may see the end of the house,-67.28
 I have some hope resumed he of my uncle s being persuaded to pay a visit at Randalls he wants to be introduced to her,-238.758
 They meant to take a long drive this morning perhaps we may hail them from some of these hills,-200.075
 She still screamed and sobbed lustily kicked her two brothers for offering to touch her and all their united soothings were ineffectual till Lady Middleton luckily remembering that in a scene of similar distress last week some apricot marmalade had been successfully applied for a bruised temple the same remedy was eagerly proposed for this unfortunate scratch and a slight intermission of screams in the young lady on hearing it gave them reason to hope that it would not be rejected She was carried out of the room therefore in her mother s arms in quest of this medicine and as the two boys chose to follow though earnestly entreated by their mother to stay behind the four young ladies were left in a quietness which the room had not known for many hours,-1323.973
 Captain Harville was no reader but he had contrived excellent accommodations and fashioned very pretty shelves for a tolerable collection of well bound volumes the property of Captain Benwick,-300.017
 Why don t he in such a case sell his horses let his house turn off his servants and make a thorough reform at once,-269.381
 When the weather is settled and I have recovered my strength said she we will take long walks together every day,-224.271
 Mr Perry said he in a voice of very strong displeasure would do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for,-233.511
 But he laughed so heartily at the recollection that Emma could not help saying,-137.924
 Their affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough to make a very creditable appearance in Mr Gray s shop,-207.767
 When I think of the kindness and favour I have met with of her excellence and patience and my uncle s generosity I am mad with joy but when I recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her and how little I deserve to be forgiven I am mad with anger,-511.885
 On this article I can fully acquit him,-95.424
 I was introducing her into good company and giving her the opportunity of pleasing some one worth having I ought not to have attempted more,-254.039
 For some moments her voice was lost but recovering herself she added and with greater calmness than before I am now perfectly satisfied I wish for no change,-292.132
 He would look for her he would find her out before the evening were over and at present perhaps it was as well to be asunder,-241.723
 Mrs Dashwood looked at Elinor with surprise,-72.839
 Margaret related something to her the next day which placed this matter in a still clearer light,-187.942
 The shortness of his visit the steadiness of his purpose in leaving them originated in the same fettered inclination the same inevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother,-269.161
 When do you write to Colonel Brandon ma am,-93.095
 No not if it were to be by the side of Barton covert and they were kept watching for two hours together,-209.193
 Perfection should not have come quite so soon,-78.187
 You will be perfectly safe you know among your friends,-101.642
 In this style she ran on never thoroughly stopped by any thing till Mr Woodhouse came into the room her vanity had then a change of object and Emma heard her saying in the same half whisper to Jane,-411.089
 It had been my doing solely mine,-76.642
 Your interest Sir Walter is in pretty safe hands,-107.893
 I should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty and she would have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and refinement But I had no choice,-282.615
 When I found he was really going to his friends at Thornberry Park for the whole day to morrow I had compassion on him,-229.485
 Mr Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in,-249.572
 Ah no have you forgot what passed in town That infamous letter Did she shew it you,-199.642
 What did you hear,-46.053
 I hope I know better now than to care for Mr Martin or to be suspected of it,-161.424
 Edward tried to return her kindness as it deserved but before such witnesses he dared not say half what he really felt,-238.488
 Not that I think Mr Martin would ever marry any body but what had had some education and been very well brought up,-227.72
 Dancing with open windows I am sure neither your father nor Mrs Weston poor Miss Taylor that was would suffer it,-214.11
 She was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke and opening the casement there immediately called Mr Knightley s attention and every syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others as if it had passed within the same apartment,-411.336
 I like old friends and Miss Jane Fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady a very pretty and a very well behaved young lady indeed,-240.201
 She said no more other subjects took their turn and the rest of the dinner passed away the dessert succeeded the children came in and were talked to and admired amid the usual rate of conversation a few clever things said a few downright silly but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor the other nothing worse than everyday remarks dull repetitions old news and heavy jokes,-740.343
 The power of disappointing them it was true must always be her s,-136.146
 Robert s offence was unpardonable but Lucy s was infinitely worse,-135.459
 Being very sure I have long lost your affections I have thought myself at liberty to bestow my own on another and have no doubt of being as happy with him as I once used to think I might be with you but I scorn to accept a hand while the heart was another s,-526.755
 Then changing from a frown to a smile No do not tell me I do not want to know what you mean Where is my father When are we to begin dancing,-302.115
 After a short pause,-45.426
 My poor mother does not know how to bear it,-92.174
 Mrs Clay s affections had overpowered her interest and she had sacrificed for the young man s sake the possibility of scheming longer for Sir Walter,-254.435
 A great many things I assure you,-67.964
 You and Miss Smith and Miss Fairfax will be three and the two Miss Coxes five and for five couple there will be plenty of room,-250.395
 She had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate,-83.177
 I have only to hope that they may be proportionately short,-99.204
 Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her,-107.635
 It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it said the young man though there are not many houses that I should presume on so far but in coming home I felt I might do any thing,-371.34
 my dear it is quite understood I give you my word,-109.891
 My mother s are really very good indeed,-84.221
 It is impossible,-28.721
 Mr Weston had been so very earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came that she could not refuse him and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man s company,-562.738
 Not at all,-30.333
 Her mind did become settled but it was settled in a gloomy dejection,-141.488
 He came back gay and self satisfied eager and busy caring nothing for Miss Woodhouse and defying Miss Smith,-200.331
 I shall never see her if she goes by London,-97.886
 When he gave his promise to his father he meditated within himself to increase the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousand pounds a piece,-287.057
 The necessity of concealing from her mother and Marianne what had been entrusted in confidence to herself though it obliged her to unceasing exertion was no aggravation of Elinor s distress,-312.933
 I warrant you Miss Marianne would have been ready to wait till matters came round,-154.071
 And had you really some at hand yourself,-93.988
 The sitting began and Harriet smiling and blushing and afraid of not keeping her attitude and countenance presented a very sweet mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist,-367.283
 I did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley Street last Tuesday and very much regretted that I was not fortunate enough to find yourselves and Mrs Jennings at home,-289.403
 The cottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home many more of his hours were spent there than at Allenham and if no general engagement collected them at the park the exercise which called him out in the morning was almost certain of ending there where the rest of the day was spent by himself at the side of Marianne and by his favourite pointer at her feet,-720.099
 It was forwarded to me from Delaford and I received it on the very morning of our intended party to Whitwell and this was the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly which I am sure must at the time have appeared strange to every body and which I believe gave offence to some,-523.73
 Elizabeth had nothing to propose of deeper efficacy,-100.382
 A few moments reflection however produced a very happy idea and she exclaimed,-134.755
 Elliot,-21.011
 And so ma am all these thing considered said Mrs Musgrove in her powerful whisper though we could have wished it different yet altogether we did not think it fair to stand out any longer for Charles Hayter was quite wild about it and Henrietta was pretty near as bad and so we thought they had better marry at once and make the best of it as many others have done before them,-735.515
 Emma was almost too much astonished to answer but Mrs Elton hardly waited for the affirmative before she went on,-187.407
 But there are other points to be considered besides his inclination,-121.907
 She even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find that Elinor and her sister were so soon to leave town as she had hoped to see more of them an exertion in which her husband who attended her into the room and hung enamoured over her accents seemed to distinguish every thing that was most affectionate and graceful,-560.745
 Harriet was silent,-35.318
 She was full of jokes and laughter and before dinner was over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers and husbands hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in Sussex and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not,-482.167
 Her first communication had reached no farther than to state the fact of the engagement and the length of time it had existed Marianne s feelings had then broken in and put an end to all regularity of detail and for some time all that could be done was to soothe her distress lessen her alarms and combat her resentment,-601.006
 I hope I am as fond of my child as any mother but I do not know that I am of any more use in the sick room than Charles for I cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill and you saw this morning that if I told him to keep quiet he was sure to begin kicking about,-583.336
 I do not understand what you mean by interrupting them said Elinor you were all in the same room together were not you,-203.24
 As to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely to fall to impede their return that was a mere joke he was afraid they would find no difficulty,-315.303
 And indeed to own the truth I do not think nurse in her heart is a very strenuous opposer of Sir Walter s making a second match,-245.745
 With her children they were in continual raptures extolling their beauty courting their notice and humouring their whims and such of their time as could be spared from the importunate demands which this politeness made on it was spent in admiration of whatever her ladyship was doing if she happened to be doing any thing or in taking patterns of some elegant new dress in which her appearance the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight,-806.473
 Her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess who had fallen little short of a mother in affection,-393.829
 How is your niece Miss Bates I want to inquire after you all but particularly your niece,-184.729
 Elinor had seen so little of Mr Palmer and in that little had seen so much variety in his address to her sister and herself that she knew not what to expect to find him in his own family,-346.616
 Charles was to return to Lyme the same afternoon and his father had at first half a mind to go with him but the ladies could not consent,-264.684
 You divert me against my conscience,-71.71
 VOLUME I,-35.231
 Their attention to our comfort their friendliness in every particular is more than I can express,-173.853
 Enscombe is in Yorkshire,-56.488
 He had wanted very much to go abroad had been very eager indeed to be allowed to travel but she would not hear of it,-213.74
 He came to the part of the room where the sitters by were collected spoke to some and walked about in front of them as if to shew his liberty and his resolution of maintaining it,-344.123
 Mary was in excellent spirits enjoying the gaiety and the change and so well satisfied with the journey in her mother in law s carriage with four horses and with her own complete independence of Camden Place that she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought and enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house as they were detailed to her,-621.448
 I shall never forget his happiness,-58.246
 I am afraid none at all,-50.93
 Can you really,-41.618
 If Mr and Mrs Weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning we may talk it over and see what can be done,-241.425
 She had only meant to oppose the too common idea of spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other not at all to represent Captain Benwick s manners as the very best that could possibly be and after a little hesitation she was beginning to say I was not entering into any comparison of the two friends but the Admiral interrupted her with,-603.6
 The cheeks which had been pale now glowed and the movements which had hesitated were decided,-159.674
 They were both so truly respectable in their happiness so disinterested in every sensation thought so much of Jane so much of every body and so little of themselves that every kindly feeling was at work for them,-373.165
 They told me something said Harriet rather hesitatingly but it is nothing of any consequence,-149.996
 Mr Elliot was rational discreet polished but he was not open,-112.881
 Pray come in do come in,-72.792
 The rest of the company soon dropt in,-82.287
 Charles and Mary also came in of course during their visit and Mr Musgrove made a point of paying his respects to Lady Russell and sat down close to her for ten minutes talking with a very raised voice but from the clamour of the children on his knees generally in vain,-505.27
 It is a reasonable and laudable pride which resists such malevolence,-101.905
 Elinor needed little observation to perceive that her reserve was a mere calmness of manner with which sense had nothing to do,-232.712
 Dining once with the Coles and having a ball talked of which never took place,-156.687
 That was a point which Anne had not been able to avoid suspecting before and instead of drawing the same conclusion as Mary from the present course of events they served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some dawning of tenderness toward herself,-458.965
 Shall I tell you my guess,-71.908
 Better accommodations he can promise them and not a less grateful welcome than at Randalls,-168.188
 I hope she does,-37.437
 Were it possible she must say it must be Edward,-101.593
 Yes certainly it does,-50.23
 Every body who saw it was pleased but Mr Elton was in continual raptures and defended it through every criticism,-191.111
 Yes he replied any body may know how highly I think of her,-125.035
 my dear you are very modest,-65.438
 As to the circumstances of her birth though in a legal sense she may be called Nobody it will not hold in common sense,-241.393
 Such a home indeed,-45.891
 I only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else,-119.688
 What a horrible idea,-50.929
 Something must be done for them whenever they leave Norland and settle in a new home,-167.854
 I am sure Lady Russell would like him,-65.327
 I must have given you up,-57.403
 He had his shepherd s son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her,-168.871
 Dear me How should I ever have borne it,-96.245
 I felt my luck Admiral I assure you replied Captain Wentworth seriously,-129.341
 But why must she consent to be with the Eltons Here is quite a separate puzzle,-166.184
 You are very kind but I know what my manners were to you So cold and artificial I had always a part to act It was a life of deceit I know that I must have disgusted you,-341.727
 I will not oppose such kind politeness but I should be sorry to be examined by a real proficient,-173.263
 But this he declined as he was dirty and wet,-112.687
 Money you know coming down with money two daughters at once it cannot be a very agreeable operation and it streightens him as to many things,-255.751
 Those soft blue eyes and all those natural graces should not be wasted on the inferior society of Highbury and its connexions,-242.011
 I am very glad indeed my dear to hear she is to be so comfortably settled,-135.864
 She met him with a hand that would be taken and a voice that expressed the affection of a sister,-198.839
 I should always be happy replied Elinor to show any mark of my esteem and friendship for Mr Ferrars but do you not perceive that my interest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary,-356.017
 Four years,-32.205
 Well said she it must be borne some time or other and it may as well be now,-161.693
 my dear as Perry says where health is at stake nothing else should be considered and if one is to travel there is not much to chuse between forty miles and an hundred Better not move at all better stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to get into a worse air,-575.917
 There are several odd looking men walking about here who I am told are sailors,-180.757
 You must allow for an injured angry woman,-89.614
 She would not have been puzzled had she dared fix on them,-110.843
 I met William Larkins continued Mr Elton as I got near the house and he told me I should not find his master at home but I did not believe him William seemed rather out of humour,-346.416
 My best love of course,-60.203
 I always say there is something direful in the sound but nothing more is positively known of the Tupmans though a good many things I assure you are suspected and yet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to my brother Mr Suckling who happens to be one of their nearest neighbours,-540.141
 She caught every syllable with panting eagerness her hand unknowingly to herself closely pressed her sister s and tears covered her cheeks,-240.616
 She had a great wish to see him,-61.655
 To a degree I could contradict this instantly but when I began to reflect that others might have felt the same her own family nay perhaps herself I was no longer at my own disposal,-356.163
 Mr Martin is a very respectable young man but I cannot admit him to be Harriet s equal and am rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her,-283.434
 He joined them immediately and with scarcely an invitation seated himself between them,-138.954
 He had reached Randalls the evening before,-71.201
 Shall I tell you,-44.655
 This discovery laid many smaller matters open,-94.101
 Have not you mistaken the day,-69.513
 I never had the smallest I assure you,-66.535
 said Elinor reproachfully a note would have answered every purpose Why was it necessary to call,-171.352
 He persisted in having loved none but her,-84.582
 I see the difference plain enough,-63.27
 And to have entered into a secret engagement with a young man under her uncle s care the son of a woman especially of such very large fortune as Mrs Ferrars is perhaps altogether a little extraordinary,-368.629
 Anne far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure replied I can easily believe it,-138.984
 But so eager and so resolute,-73.727
 Her next beginning was,-51.864
 The only thing I do not thoroughly like is that she seems to be sitting out of doors with only a little shawl over her shoulders and it makes one think she must catch cold,-344.3
 Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would be very glad to marry him,-128.664
 They are some of my very old friends,-84.391
 She had long resolved that one and twenty should be the period,-118.116
 The others joined them and it was a group in which Anne found herself also necessarily included,-174.419
 The wants and sufferings of the poor family however were the first subject on meeting,-167.129
 Difference,-11.28
 Voices approached the shop or rather one voice and two ladies Mrs Weston and Miss Bates met them at the door,-214.379
 Yes yes pray pass me added her husband with a sort of sneering consciousness I have nothing to say that can entertain Miss Woodhouse or any other young lady,-279.937
 My dear Harriet what do you mean,-71.794
 They were sneering and negligent,-53.163
 continued Mrs Musgrove he was grown so steady and such an excellent correspondent while he was under your care,-203.261
 As you will do it it will indeed to use your own words be an exquisite possession,-180.582
 And moreover if you must go to the sea it had better not have been to South End,-166.291
 If it failed to produce equal exertion it could not be an equal conviction,-146.512
 She had not even a share in his opening compliments Her name was not mentioned and there was so striking a change in all this and such an ill judged solemnity of leave taking in his graceful acknowledgments as she thought at first could not escape her father s suspicion,-494.313
 I will say no more about him cried Emma you turn every thing to evil,-149.198
 I am come here to bespeak Fanny a seal,-90.566
 So then it all came out and the long and the short of the matter by all I can learn seems to be this,-229.339
 Emma listened and looked and soon perceived that Frank Churchill s state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of humour,-250.425
 These matters are always a secret till it is found out that every body knows them,-170.842
 Kitty a fair but frozen maid,-79.166
 Mrs Elton had undoubtedly the advantage at this time in vanity completely gratified for though she had intended to begin with Frank Churchill she could not lose by the change,-294.168
 The next time you write to your good father Miss Elliot pray give him my compliments and Mrs Croft s and say that we are settled here quite to our liking and have no fault at all to find with the place,-421.031
 And in a louder steadier tone he concluded with He will soon be gone,-149.066
 Emma was gratified to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance,-243.799
 They were lucky enough to find Lady Middleton at home and Sir John came in before their visit ended,-195.484
 Elinor laughed,-30.747
 She was your governess I think,-62.456
 She was seated in her mother s lap covered with kisses her wound bathed with lavender water by one of the Miss Steeles who was on her knees to attend her and her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by the other,-361.52
 I only wish replied her sister there were any thing I COULD do which might be of comfort to you,-187.24
 She had not deserved it she had often been negligent or perverse slighting his advice or even wilfully opposing him insensible of half his merits and quarrelling with him because he would not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own but still from family attachment and habit and thorough excellence of mind he had loved her and watched over her from a girl with an endeavour to improve her and an anxiety for her doing right which no other creature had at all shared,-896.578
 One other short call in Harley Street in which Elinor received her brother s congratulations on their travelling so far towards Barton without any expense and on Colonel Brandon s being to follow them to Cleveland in a day or two completed the intercourse of the brother and sisters in town and a faint invitation from Fanny to come to Norland whenever it should happen to be in their way which of all things was the most unlikely to occur with a more warm though less public assurance from John to Elinor of the promptitude with which he should come to see her at Delaford was all that foretold any meeting in the country,-1119.88
 And when she has forgiven you perhaps a little humility may be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement almost as imprudent in HER eyes as the first,-290.561
 Mr Elton looked all happiness at this proposition and nothing could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage,-320.72
 He had left the country in consequence,-66.085
 Well my dear I must be gone before I have had half my talk out,-141.678
 The conviction seemed real he looked as if he felt it,-108.936
 As good a kind of fellow as ever lived I assure you,-123.435
 Do you know any family of that name,-79.881
 She paused a few moments,-50.665
 Have you any thing to send or say besides the love which nobody carries,-150.044
 Now this must be very bad for you said he suddenly rousing from a little reverie to be coming and finding us here,-232.548
 Elinor first spoke,-41.08
 Mr Woodhouse hesitated Not near so often my dear as I could wish,-132.86
 After this speech he was gone as soon as possible,-96.354
 But so little were they anymore than the others inclined to oblige her that if Sir John dined from home she might spend a whole day without hearing any other raillery on the subject than what she was kind enough to bestow on herself,-437.699
 Elton may talk sentimentally but he will act rationally,-109.662
 But when this passed away when her spirits became collected when she saw that to the perfect good breeding of the gentleman he united frankness and vivacity and above all when she heard him declare that of music and dancing he was passionately fond she gave him such a look of approbation as secured the largest share of his discourse to herself for the rest of his stay,-669.622
 She was silent Elinor s security sunk but her self command did not sink with it,-161.969
 He knows I have a thorough regard for him and all his family and I believe considers me as one of his best friends,-215.553
 A very few days had passed after this adventure when Harriet came one morning to Emma with a small parcel in her hand and after sitting down and hesitating thus began,-314.119
 His value for rank and connexion she perceived was greater than hers,-146.541
 Why do you smile,-49.265
 It is the garden of England you know,-75.932
 She loved every body was interested in every body s happiness quicksighted to every body s merits thought herself a most fortunate creature and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother and so many good neighbours and friends and a home that wanted for nothing,-458.187
 They were never tolerated at Maple Grove,-68.817
 Elinor s marriage divided her as little from her family as could well be contrived without rendering the cottage at Barton entirely useless for her mother and sisters spent much more than half their time with her,-362.761
 Then she had indeed been a pitiable object for she had caught cold on the journey and had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again confined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain and all this among strangers with the absolute necessity of having a regular nurse and finances at that moment particularly unfit to meet any extraordinary expense,-664.879
 Quite wrong my dear aunt there is no likeness at all,-117.696
 said she,-23.555
 The sight of Mrs Clay in such favour and of Anne so overlooked was a perpetual provocation to her there and vexed her as much when she was away as a person in Bath who drinks the water gets all the new publications and has a very large acquaintance has time to be vexed,-520.75
 Could it be Mr Elliot,-53.46
 My dear friend cried Lucy as soon as they were by themselves I come to talk to you of my happiness,-194.884
 My first doth affliction denote Which my second is destin d to feel And my whole is the best antidote That affliction to soften and heal,-293.383
 Mrs Cole has servants to send,-74.318
 I am persuaded that Mrs Smith suspects his regard for Marianne disapproves of it perhaps because she has other views for him and on that account is eager to get him away and that the business which she sends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him,-474.506
 This is like giving ourselves a slap to be sure,-95.038
 She watched him well,-45.156
 He was determined at least not to mar it by an imprudent marriage and I know it was his belief whether justly or not of course I cannot decide that your father and sister in their civilities and invitations were designing a match between the heir and the young lady and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence,-645.817
 CHAPTER XVII,-29.909
 Jane desired me to do it so I always do and so I began to day with my usual caution but no sooner did I come to the mention of her being unwell than I burst out quite frightened with Bless me,-417.888
 I am sure I wonder my heart is not quite broke,-101.717
 Luckily Lady Middleton s mother had arrived at Barton within the last hour and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman he hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as they might imagine,-358.672
 You provide for the family you know with a smile at his father,-122.08
 Well well I am ready and turning again to Emma but you must not be expecting such a very fine young man you have only had my account you know I dare say he is really nothing extraordinary though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very different conviction,-494.482
 She boldly acknowledged herself flattered and continued her enquiries,-113.99
 I was exceedingly pleased to hear that Mrs Ferrars considered it in that light a very gratifying circumstance you know to us all,-221.414
 They will be so very happy to see you,-68.717
 Why to be sure said he seeming to recollect himself people have little have very little in their power,-195.901
 My dear Harriet what are you thinking of,-84.386
 Elinor with a very heavy heart aware of the pain she was going to communicate and perceiving by Marianne s letter how ill she had succeeded in laying any foundation for it then sat down to write her mother an account of what had passed and entreat her directions for the future while Marianne who came into the drawing room on Mrs Jennings s going away remained fixed at the table where Elinor wrote watching the advancement of her pen grieving over her for the hardship of such a task and grieving still more fondly over its effect on her mother,-998.567
 The very last person whom one should expect to be forgotten My dear Mr E he must have left a message for you I am sure he must Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric and his servants forgot it,-385.859
 It is yet too early in life to despair of such a happiness,-133.409
 In spite of her vexation she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous that she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to perform by Harriet which Mrs Weston had just gone through by herself,-364.819
 She looked down as she said this amiably bashful with only one side glance at her companion to observe its effect on her,-212.853
 Edward have got some business at Oxford he says so he must go there for a time and after THAT as soon as he can light upon a Bishop he will be ordained,-320.005
 here comes your beau Nancy my cousin said t other day when she saw him crossing the street to the house,-228.071
 I am afraid it cannot take place very soon,-87.276
 Emma was pleased with the thought and producing the box the table was quickly scattered over with alphabets which no one seemed so much disposed to employ as their two selves,-330.725
 She says she is afraid there will be draughts in the passage though every thing has been done One door nailed up Quantities of matting My dear Jane indeed you must,-296.132
 Oh what a sweet house How very beautiful There are the yellow curtains that Miss Nash admires so much,-203.134
 Marianne could never love by halves and her whole heart became in time as much devoted to her husband as it had once been to Willoughby,-253.762
 Now will be the time,-47.532
 Astonished and shocked at so unlover like a speech she was almost ready to cry out Lord,-174.084
 He is in Highbury every now and then and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to Kingston,-216.186
 I thought he meant to try his skill by his manner of declining it yesterday,-158.047
 You must have done well,-45.781
 Yes I have called there passing the door I thought it better,-123.364
 I thought you were speaking of some man of property Mr Wentworth was nobody I remember quite unconnected nothing to do with the Strafford family,-239.222
 A young woman if she fall into bad hands may be teazed and kept at a distance from those she wants to be with but one cannot comprehend a young man s being under such restraint as not to be able to spend a week with his father if he likes it,-497.572
 She must abide by the evil of having refused him whatever it may be and as to the refusal itself I will not pretend to say that I might not influence her a little but I assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do,-430.616
 She read the concluding lines and was all flutter and happiness,-121.19
 cried Sir John what is HE in the country,-92.113
 She sometimes endeavoured for a few minutes to read but the book was soon thrown aside and she returned to the more interesting employment of walking backwards and forwards across the room pausing for a moment whenever she came to the window in hopes of distinguishing the long expected rap,-515.207
 She seemed to be in the middle of some eager speech,-99.754
 They were alike too in a general benevolence of temper and a strong habit of regard for every old acquaintance,-202.736
 None I thank you unless you will give me the pleasure of your company the little way our road lies together,-223.541
 Disputable however as might be the taste of such a termination it was in itself a charming walk and the view which closed it extremely pretty The considerable slope at nearly the foot of which the Abbey stood gradually acquired a steeper form beyond its grounds and at half a mile distant was a bank of considerable abruptness and grandeur well clothed with wood and at the bottom of this bank favourably placed and sheltered rose the Abbey Mill Farm with meadows in front and the river making a close and handsome curve around it,-999.082
 She received no other answer than an artificial assenting smile followed by a contemptuous glance as he turned away which Anne perfectly knew the meaning of,-286.071
 Well I am so sorry Oh,-58.288
 He had never been an unhappy man his own temper had secured him from that even in his first marriage but his second must shew him how delightful a well judging and truly amiable woman could be and must give him the pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen to excite gratitude than to feel it,-645.672
 He appears rough to you said Emma because you are so very gentle yourself but if you could compare him with other papas you would not think him rough,-286.185
 cried Marianne there has been no engagement,-77.81
 I thought you had lost half your property at least,-104.229
 John Knightley only was in mute astonishment That a man who might have spent his evening quietly at home after a day of business in London should set off again and walk half a mile to another man s house for the sake of being in mixed company till bed time of finishing his day in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers was a circumstance to strike him deeply,-743.442
 They had no conversation together no intercourse but what the commonest civility required,-147.829
 At Christmas every body invites their friends about them and people think little of even the worst weather,-198.411
 Emma s going away directly after tea might be giving offence,-115.296
 I am sure I cannot imagine how they will spend half of it and as to your giving them more it is quite absurd to think of it,-241.052
 You will not be sorry to find yourself at home,-87.727
 And what did the Colonel say,-66.965
 I was going to observe sir said Frank Churchill that one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of any body s catching cold so much less danger at the Crown than at Randalls,-369.68
 Were you often in the same society,-79.281
 Quite otherwise indeed if I understood Miss Fairfax s opinion last night,-132.76
 She could hardly determine what her own expectation of its event really was though she earnestly tried to drive away the notion of its being possible to end otherwise at last than in the marriage of Edward and Lucy,-398.564
 Ha,-23.914
 As soon as she came to her own name it was irresistible every line relating to herself was interesting and almost every line agreeable and when this charm ceased the subject could still maintain itself by the natural return of her former regard for the writer and the very strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her at that moment,-621.119
 She blessed the favouring blindness,-61.561
 Do you compare your conduct with his,-83.31
 You may well be amazed returned Mrs Weston still averting her eyes and talking on with eagerness that Emma might have time to recover You may well be amazed,-310.784
 said Elinor,-23.103
 At last however my resolution was taken and I had determined as soon as I could engage her alone to justify the attentions I had so invariably paid her and openly assure her of an affection which I had already taken such pains to display,-464.32
 Pray excuse me but supposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy it cannot be expected that Emma accountable to nobody but her father who perfectly approves the acquaintance should put an end to it so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself,-468.508
 The wedding over and the bride people gone her father and herself were left to dine together with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening,-295.034
 Have you been lately in Sussex,-77.617
 He said he should not stay out long but he has never come back and now it is almost one,-189.215
 It was also a very early speculation with Emma,-91.105
 Aye that may suit your humble ideas of yourself I know what a modest creature you are but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any thing that may offer any inferior commonplace situation in a family not moving in a certain circle or able to command the elegancies of life,-567.47
 Though now the middle of December there had yet been no weather to prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise and on the morrow Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family who lived a little way out of Highbury,-471.638
 How fast I made money in her,-78.131
 Dinner parties and evening parties were made for him and his lady and invitations flowed in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they were never to have a disengaged day,-324.53
 She was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length by the eagerness of Harriet s wondering questions,-318.781
 With such a reward for her tears the child was too wise to cease crying,-161.58
 Mr Elton was still talking still engaged in some interesting detail and Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday s party at his friend Cole s and that she was come in herself for the Stilton cheese the north Wiltshire the butter the cellery the beet root and all the dessert,-568.142
 Such a letter could not be read without putting Anne in a glow and Mrs Smith observing the high colour in her face said,-242.757
 Captain Wentworth s eyes were also turned towards her,-89.179
 The parties stood thus,-53.224
 or is it equally criminal in every body,-85.607
 NOW he felt astonished himself that he had never yet been to the place,-138.233
 She would keep the peace if possible and there was something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits the all sufficiency of home to himself whence resulted her brother s disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse and those to whom it was important It had a high claim to forbearance,-589.812
 This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted and Mr Weston has done very well for himself but he must have knocked up every body else,-267.046
 I am very sorry to hear Miss Fairfax of your being out this morning in the rain,-150.883
 no and Emma could just catch the words so superior to Mr,-130.156
 Nobody cares for a letter the thing is to be always happy with pleasant companions,-157.464
 It is time for us to be going indeed,-82.803
 Might not the evening end in a dance,-89.875
 Depend upon it Emma a sensible man would find no difficulty in it,-135.04
 Emma had feelings less of curiosity than of pride or propriety to make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects and she made a point of Harriet s going with her that the worst of the business might be gone through as soon as possible,-469.278
 she exclaimed he is there he is there Oh,-95.891
 So I said I was very much obliged to him you know I could not do less and then he went back to Elizabeth and I came round by the stables I believe I did but I hardly knew where I was or any thing about it,-403.678
 Get up and go over all the rooms in the house if you like it,-136.571
 You should not have suspected me now the case is so different and my age is so different,-187.905
 Trust to me,-24.495
 One cannot wonder one cannot wonder,-74.438
 Cole,-22.117
 It has given me such an abhorrence of annuities that I am sure I would not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world,-257.234
 To Mrs Jennings to the Middletons he has been long and intimately known they equally love and respect him and even my own knowledge of him though lately acquired is very considerable and so highly do I value and esteem him that if Marianne can be happy with him I shall be as ready as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing to us in the world,-678.428
 Cannot you my dear Emma cannot you form a guess as to what you are to hear,-173.632
 No he thought it very far from an improvement a very bad plan much worse than the other,-172.672
 She spoke to him ordered entreated and insisted in vain,-114.14
 Only one more papa only for Mr Elton,-89.234
 You must have seen that I did,-61.881
 Yes a good deal nearer,-56.5
 But who else was there to employ,-84.939
 The event has proved that I was a cunning fool providing with great circumspection for a possible opportunity of making myself contemptible and wretched for ever,-265.709
 But I have just left Marianne in bed and I hope almost asleep and as I think nothing will be of so much service to her as rest if you will give me leave I will drink the wine myself,-388.683
 In this manner they had continued about a quarter of an hour when Marianne whose nerves could not then bear any sudden noise was startled by a rap at the door,-319.768
 The first error and the worst lay at her door,-107.253
 But it is very remarkable that she should always hear Jane better than she does me,-150.122
 In one respect perhaps Mr Elton s manners are superior to Mr Knightley s or Mr Weston s,-168.79
 About this time the two Miss Steeles lately arrived at their cousin s house in Bartlett s Buildings Holburn presented themselves again before their more grand relations in Conduit and Berkeley Streets and were welcomed by them all with great cordiality,-456.807
 This is very strange sure he need not wait to be older,-123.854
 Fortunately he had a younger brother who was more promising,-113.419
 Between them it was more the intimacy of sisters,-106.353
 I cannot name a day said he till I have spoken to some others whom I would wish to meet you,-206.28
 She was convinced that Margaret had fixed on a person whose name she could not bear with composure to become a standing joke with Mrs Jennings,-258.041
 So you are come at last,-62.036
 how poor they will be I must see what I can give them towards furnishing their house,-168.848
 Mr Woodhouse was resigned,-46.474
 CHAPTER 15,-32.079
 Mrs Elton s resources were inadequate to such an attack,-100.255
 The expense shall not be thought of and though he is so liberal and so fond of Jane that I dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance we could not suffer it to be so you know,-363.633
 And then lowering her voice I suppose Mrs Jennings has heard all about it,-142.89
 Her mind was in a state of flutter and wonder which made it impossible for her to be collected,-177.656
 no there is but one,-52.69
 Marianne s ideas were still at intervals fixed incoherently on her mother and whenever she mentioned her name it gave a pang to the heart of poor Elinor who reproaching herself for having trifled with so many days of illness and wretched for some immediate relief fancied that all relief might soon be in vain that every thing had been delayed too long and pictured to herself her suffering mother arriving too late to see this darling child or to see her rational,-856.43
 Will you promise me to mention it when you see them again,-122.516
 That is I presume it to be so on her side and I can answer for its being so on his,-186.111
 Had he said any thing to bear a different construction I should not have believed him,-149.265
 When his letter to Mrs Weston arrived Emma had the perusal of it and she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her at first shake her head over her own sensations and think she had undervalued their strength,-413.743
 I hope he will be calling soon,-66.841
 Songs and proverbs all talk of woman s fickleness,-80.912
 How horrid all this is,-55.522
 I left them there and came on to Hartfield impatient for your opinion and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot,-291.049
 She was just in time to see him turn into the Concert Room,-124.776
 People who have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style,-156.132
 I can imagine that if you as you are Mr Knightley were to be transported and placed all at once in Mr Frank Churchill s situation you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for him and it might have a very good effect,-414.522
 It would place her in the same village with Captain Wentworth within half a mile of him they would have to frequent the same church and there must be intercourse between the two families,-331.034
 There we differ Mary said Anne,-72.564
 A heavy scene however awaited me before I could leave Devonshire I was engaged to dine with you on that very day some apology was therefore necessary for my breaking this engagement,-337.856
 Emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about Mr Frank Churchill s not coming except as a disappointment at Randalls,-253.592
 CHAPTER XV,-29.909
 Thank you thank you but on no account I would rather walk And for me to be afraid of walking alone I who may so soon have to guard others,-310.548
 She would certainly have risen to their blessings if she could but she did not want to lessen theirs,-175.336
 I will not reason here nor will I stop for YOU to expatiate on the absurdity and the worse than absurdity of scrupling to engage my faith where my honour was already bound,-350.423
 She could only offer one solution it was perhaps for Elizabeth s sake,-130.426
 He told me at parting that he should soon write and he spoke in a manner which seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now,-277.557
 A sensible man and he had looked like a very sensible man why should it be an object to him,-187.232
 What would you advise me to do in such a case Miss Dashwood,-126.807
 We will not despair however,-57.469
 Long before I was enough recovered to talk I was perfectly able to reflect,-148.189
 Time she knew must be allowed for this being thoroughly done and she could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr Elton in particular but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet s age and with the entire extinction of all hope such a progress might be made towards a state of composure by the time of Mr Elton s return as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them,-932.711
 said Miss Bates joyfully my mother is so pleased she says she cannot bear to have the poor old Vicarage without a mistress,-233.592
 This had happened the year before,-68.786
 Though his eyes had been long opened even before his acquaintance with Elinor began to her ignorance and a want of liberality in some of her opinions they had been equally imputed by him to her want of education and till her last letter reached him he had always believed her to be a well disposed good hearted girl and thoroughly attached to himself,-626.497
 You do not know it I dare say but two or three years ago I had a great passion for taking likenesses and attempted several of my friends and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general,-355.74
 I see how it is said she,-60.787
 He cannot bear the idea of not being Sir William,-105.138
 She held the parcel towards her and Emma read the words Most precious treasures on the top,-183.375
 Mr Perry has been with her as you probably heard,-98.234
 That crime has been the origin of every lesser one and of all his present discontents,-158.757
 That was the act of a very very young man one too young to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure,-257.491
 There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as that said Mr Knightley feelingly and for a moment or two he had done,-244.369
 I am so ill I can hardly speak,-73.913
 If Mr Elton on his return made his own indifference as evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do she could not imagine Harriet s persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the recollection of him,-408.696
 She had set out from Mrs Goddard s half an hour ago she had been afraid it would rain she had been afraid it would pour down every moment but she thought she might get to Hartfield first she had hurried on as fast as possible but then as she was passing by the house where a young woman was making up a gown for her she thought she would just step in and see how it went on and though she did not seem to stay half a moment there soon after she came out it began to rain and she did not know what to do so she ran on directly as fast as she could and took shelter at Ford s,-1159.449
 Marianne looked at her steadily and said You know Elinor that this is a kind of talking which I cannot bear,-208.331
 said Marianne money can only give happiness where there is nothing else to give it,-151.641
 May she always be poor if she can employ her riches no better,-156.091
 You must think one five hundred million times more above me than the other,-152.95
 Why to own the truth I am afraid you are rather thrown away and that with every disposition to bear there will be nothing to be borne,-260.001
 always my kindest friend on every occasion,-94.045
 I hope not he replied trying to look cheerful and with a forced smile presently added It is I who may rather expect to be ill for I am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment,-360.916
 Your uncle,-31.806
 laughing heartily I would not venture over a horsepond in it,-110.536
 We are sure of excellent fires continued he and every thing in the greatest comfort,-146.85
 in a tone of wonder and pity I had no idea that the law had been so great a slavery,-187.504
 Such events are very interesting but the suspense of them cannot last long,-150.093
 Lady Dalrymple Lady Dalrymple was the rejoicing sound and with all the eagerness compatible with anxious elegance Sir Walter and his two ladies stepped forward to meet her,-287.892
 He had intended on first arriving to proceed very soon into Shropshire and visit the brother settled in that country but the attractions of Uppercross induced him to put this off,-342.725
 The neighbourhood was not large but the Musgroves were visited by everybody and had more dinner parties and more callers more visitors by invitation and by chance than any other family,-333.201
 While you were in the smallest degree wavering I said nothing about it because I would not influence but it would have been the loss of a friend to me,-255.117
 A day or two passed without producing anything,-92.568
 He was shy and disposed to abstraction but the engaging mildness of her countenance and gentleness of her manners soon had their effect and Anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion,-342.649
 That was what I said immediately I was most uncommonly shocked indeed Poor Edward he has done for himself completely shut himself out for ever from all decent society but as I directly said to my mother I am not in the least surprised at it from his style of education it was always to be expected,-553.097
 She then took another line of expediency and looking into the doubtful room observed,-167.108
 She remembered what Mr Knightley had once said to her about Mr Elton the caution he had given the conviction he had professed that Mr Elton would never marry indiscreetly and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she had reached herself,-498.773
 When they stopped at the door Mrs Jennings recollected that there was a lady at the other end of the street on whom she ought to call and as she had no business at Gray s it was resolved that while her young friends transacted their s she should pay her visit and return for them,-524.483
 His air his coat his horse,-80.281
 It must be terrible for you to hear it talked of and as for your sister I am sure I would not mention a word about it to her for the world,-260.748
 Yes he replied gravely once I have,-74.222
 How could she have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued,-162.975
 It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy She was extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the Eltons and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much alike and his praise of Harriet his concession in her favour was peculiarly gratifying,-612.226
 But whether she would do for a lady s maid I am sure I can t tell,-151.571
 cried Mary in an ecstasy just as I said,-93.482
 Very well replied Emma a most natural feeling and the longer it lasts the better I shall be pleased,-191.315
 A piece of paper was found on the table this morning dropt we suppose by a fairy containing a very pretty charade and we have just copied it in,-308.879
 Mr Knightley cannot stop,-48.658
 It was a pity perhaps that he had not come last night for though the child seemed well now very well considering it would probably have been better if Perry had seen it,-313.108
 You must see the difference,-52.182
 It had not been built many years and was in good repair,-117.274
 Mr Woodhouse had been exceedingly well amused,-73.727
 The waiter came into the room soon afterwards,-83.585
 Marianne not contented with absolutely refusing to go herself was very urgent to prevent her sister s going at all and Mrs Jennings though her carriage was always at Elinor s service so very much disliked Mrs John Dashwood that not even her curiosity to see how she looked after the late discovery nor her strong desire to affront her by taking Edward s part could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again,-758.733
 Mrs Harville must be an odd mother to part with them so long,-126.756
 She was now lying on the faded sofa of the pretty little drawing room the once elegant furniture of which had been gradually growing shabby under the influence of four summers and two children and on Anne s appearing greeted her with,-415.987
 I could not have answered it to my conscience to let it fall into any other hands,-163.445
 They were permitted to go alone and with a cordial nod from one and a graceful bow from the other the two gentlemen took leave,-248.41
 I had been grossly wrong and must abide the consequences,-97.14
 Her countenance perhaps might express some watchfulness but the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought in her sister,-248.464
 By a former marriage Mr Henry Dashwood had one son by his present lady three daughters,-189.957
 You know what you are about,-53.97
 I am very glad I did think of her,-67.672
 Willoughby on his side gave every proof of his pleasure in their acquaintance which an evident wish of improving it could offer,-232.138
 She was quite determined not to utter a word that should hurt Jane Fairfax s feelings and they followed the other ladies out of the room arm in arm with an appearance of good will highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each,-437.522
 The first month after their marriage was spent with their friend at the Mansion house from whence they could superintend the progress of the Parsonage and direct every thing as they liked on the spot could chuse papers project shrubberies and invent a sweep,-479.468
 He had seen Mrs Croft too she was at Taunton with the admiral and had been present almost all the time they were talking the matter over,-256.457
 John Dashwood was greatly astonished but his nature was calm not open to provocation and he never wished to offend anybody especially anybody of good fortune,-291.711
 Sir Walter wanted to know whether the Crofts travelled with four horses and whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of Bath as it might suit Miss Elliot and himself to visit in but had little curiosity beyond,-420.109
 Elinor would not speak,-39.652
 Indeed,-18.713
 I made her take her shawl for the evenings are not warm her large new shawl Mrs Dixon s wedding present So kind of her to think of my mother,-288.604
 Is anything the matter with her,-62.967
 It would only be giving trouble and distress,-88.456
 It was too old a story Robert Martin had probably ceased to think of Harriet They took a few turns together along the walk The shade was most refreshing and Emma found it the pleasantest part of the day,-398.657
 I am very sure you did me good,-72.43
 said Edward willing to say any thing that might introduce another subject,-123.986
 It had originated in misapprehension entirely,-75.625
 Emma finding her so determined upon neglecting her music had nothing more to say and after a moment s pause Mrs Elton chose another subject,-258.667
 cried Marianne,-24.243
 The unpersuadable point which he did not mention Emma guessed to be good behaviour to his father,-162.235
 Lady Russell had not been arrived five minutes the day before when a full account of the whole had burst on her but still it must be talked of she must make enquiries she must regret the imprudence lament the result and Captain Wentworth s name must be mentioned by both,-494.246
 If Jane does not get well soon we will call in Mr Perry,-143.448
 Would I,-33.648
 They were both in ecstasies,-44.227
 You would have thrown yourself out of all good society,-103.234
 You were mentioning May,-53.565
 She almost ran out of the room and as soon as the door was closed burst into tears of joy which at first she thought would never cease,-268.633
 But it was more probable that he should be come to stay,-105.652
 The next morning brought Mr Frank Churchill again,-78.869
 Why does not Perry see her,-65.731
 Nobody talked about it,-44.53
 We both abhor suspense,-55.484
 When people come in this manner on purpose to ask us how can one say no,-173.394
 Mrs Musgrove interposed,-38.981
 But he told you that he loved you,-74.476
 This desponding turn of mind though it could not be communicated to Mrs Dashwood gave additional pain to them all in the parting which shortly took place and left an uncomfortable impression on Elinor s feelings especially which required some trouble and time to subdue,-469.041
 They were combined only of anger against herself mortification and deep concern,-135.489
 If their evenings at the park were concluded with cards he cheated himself and all the rest of the party to get her a good hand,-250.731
 Whether he were overhearing too she could not determine,-104.559
 She would take place of me then and Henrietta would not dislike that,-132.762
 And who are the Ellisons,-45.583
 So passed the first three weeks,-70.057
 And they both long to see you of all things for they have heard at Exeter that you are the most beautiful creatures in the world and I have told them it is all very true and a great deal more,-365.575
 Oh yes,-27.147
 They were all three walking about together for an hour or two first round the shrubberies of Hartfield and afterwards in Highbury,-228.078
 Should I,-33.01
 You are quite in the right replied Elinor calmly,-89.617
 Do you I have no doubt,-51.503
 Tell me that not only your house will remain the same but that I shall ever find you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling and that you will always consider me with the kindness which has made everything belonging to you so dear to me,-455.911
 Somehow or other I never happened to be staying at Barton while he was at Allenham,-151.956
 Charles and Mary still talked on in the same style he half serious and half jesting maintaining the scheme for the play and she invariably serious most warmly opposing it and not omitting to make it known that however determined to go to Camden Place herself she should not think herself very well used if they went to the play without her,-615.937
 While he stood as if meaning to go but not going her father began his inquiries,-177.882
 Edward made no answer,-47.005
 The deception could not continue after this and an explanation immediately took place by which both gained considerable amusement for the moment without any material loss of happiness to either for Mrs Jennings only exchanged one form of delight for another and still without forfeiting her expectation of the first,-520.652
 That she was to all appearance in the last stage of a consumption was yes in such a situation it was my greatest comfort,-222.267
 He had a great deal to say in return and very entertainingly but Emma s feelings were chiefly with Jane in the argument and on leaving Randalls and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men she felt that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill and really regarding him as she did with friendship she had never been more sensible of Mr Knightley s high superiority of character,-667.245
 Sometimes I thought it had been but it never was,-94.366
 I mean that he has done it answered Mr Knightley with smiling but determined decision and been accepted,-187.845
 A little while ago every letter to Isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties dinners at Mr Cole s or balls at the Crown,-264.43
 And yet said Emma beginning hastily and with an arch look but soon stopping it was better however to know the worst at once she hurried on And yet perhaps you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it is,-421.958
 Poor Brandon,-30.477
 CHAPTER 48,-20.766
 I know he had horses to day for we arrived together and I laughed at him about it but he said not a word that could betray,-258.845
 He got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor s merits without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it was to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse s character than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor s,-468.848
 Depend upon it Mrs Churchill does every thing that any other fine lady ever did,-158.143
 The next question was,-48.104
 My astonishment but it would be impossible to describe what I felt,-116.717
 To live no longer with the decencies even of a private gentleman,-122.05
 The Willoughbys left town as soon as they were married and Elinor now hoped as there could be no danger of her seeing either of them to prevail on her sister who had never yet left the house since the blow first fell to go out again by degrees as she had done before,-501.584
 No Marianne never,-39.505
 She had engaged to go as governess to Mrs Smallridge s children a dear friend of Mrs Elton s a neighbour of Maple Grove and by the bye I wonder how Mrs Elton bears the disappointment,-362.204
 How do you do my dear,-55.512
 With a faint blush she presently replied,-86.231
 This is breaking a head and giving a plaster truly,-116.049
 said Mrs John Knightley It is so long since I have seen her except now and then for a moment accidentally in town,-211.868
 Mr Knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity,-99.2
 It exactly answers my idea of a fine country because it unites beauty with utility and I dare say it is a picturesque one too because you admire it I can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories grey moss and brush wood but these are all lost on me,-524.948
 I had imagined him I confess a degree or two nearer gentility,-127.807
 Dear Miss Woodhouse how could you so mistake me,-92.177
 Yes and Miss Atkinson who dined with him once at the Wallises says he is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with,-246.327
 The very day of Mr Elton s going to London produced a fresh occasion for Emma s services towards her friend,-203.639
 Mrs Jennings sat on Elinor s right hand and they had not been long seated before she leant behind her and Willoughby and said to Marianne loud enough for them both to hear I have found you out in spite of all your tricks,-416.803
 But that it was so had not only been declared by Lucy s eyes at the time but was declared over again the next morning more openly for at her particular desire Lady Middleton set her down in Berkeley Street on the chance of seeing Elinor alone to tell her how happy she was,-536.667
 To Lady Russell indeed she was a most dear and highly valued god daughter favourite and friend,-181.782
 Her faith was plighted and Mr Elliot s character like the Sultaness Scheherazade s head must live another day,-182.094
 You misled me by the term gentleman,-81.438
 Though I think he had better not have married,-84.922
 Before they were beyond her hearing however Louisa spoke again,-117.94
 Let me entreat you to run no risks,-85.335
 Marianne seemed much struck,-53.708
 His manners to THEM though calm were perfectly kind to Mrs Jennings most attentively civil and on Colonel Brandon s coming in soon after himself he eyed him with a curiosity which seemed to say that he only wanted to know him to be rich to be equally civil to HIM,-495.004
 for presently she came forward came quite up to me and asked me how I did and seemed ready to shake hands if I would,-262.976
 I do not know but I can hardly suppose that at Admiral Croft s time of life and in his profession he should not have many acquaintance in such a place as this,-285.464
 I protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one else,-126.572
 Miss Elliot surrounded by her cousins and the principal object of Colonel Wallis s gallantry was quite contented,-188.086
 A crowd in a little room Miss Woodhouse you have the art of giving pictures in a few words,-185.758
 But it WAS said I know very well and by more than one for Miss Godby told Miss Sparks that nobody in their senses could expect Mr Ferrars to give up a woman like Miss Morton with thirty thousand pounds to her fortune for Lucy Steele that had nothing at all and I had it from Miss Sparks myself,-571.77
 He must be gone within a few hours though without feeling any real alarm for his aunt to lessen his repugnance,-210.0
 But in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife with Oh,-120.066
 You want your neighbours opinions,-63.999
 Here is some mistake I am sure some dreadful mistake,-110.124
 He was brought not from doubt or suspense but from misery to happiness and the change was openly spoken in such a genuine flowing grateful cheerfulness as his friends had never witnessed in him before,-379.394
 But Sir John would not be satisfied the carriage should be sent for them and they must come,-159.469
 But he was confident that he should soon be rich full of life and ardour he knew that he should soon have a ship and soon be on a station that would lead to everything he wanted,-369.055
 From that evening or at least from the time of Miss Woodhouse s encouraging her to think of him Harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more than he had been used to do and of his having indeed quite a different manner towards her a manner of kindness and sweetness Latterly she had been more and more aware of it,-576.004
 When the Crofts called this morning they called here afterwards did not they,-150.15
 It was now his object to marry,-65.273
 When it came to such a pitch as this she was not able to refrain from a start or a heavy sigh or even from walking about the room for a few seconds and the only source whence any thing like consolation or composure could be drawn was in the resolution of her own better conduct and the hope that however inferior in spirit and gaiety might be the following and every future winter of her life to the past it would yet find her more rational more acquainted with herself and leave her less to regret when it were gone,-980.09
 So there I have the whip hand of you,-84.184
 He was thinking,-33.434
 My dear Miss Fairfax young ladies are very sure to be cared for I hope your good grand mama and aunt are well,-227.171
 Chapter 10,-34.249
 But you look grave Marianne do you disapprove your sister s choice,-130.551
 We really seem quite the fashion,-77.528
 Indeed they are very delightful apples and Mrs Wallis does them full justice only we do not have them baked more than twice and Mr Woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times but Miss Woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it,-468.402
 The very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove My brother Mr Suckling s seat a comparison of Hartfield to Maple Grove,-259.921
 Papa do you not think it an excellent improvement,-97.447
 there was no getting away from one s self,-94.728
 I do assure you he replied that I have long thought on this point as you think now,-163.424
 To be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum on every rent day is by no means desirable it takes away one s independence,-296.437
 What say you to Mr Weston and Mr Elton,-76.97
 Esteem him,-20.048
 I give you notice that as I find your son so I shall judge of him I am no flatterer,-187.49
 Knightley,-17.372
 Mrs Jennings enforced the necessity,-57.474
 If a man had not a wife he soon wants to be afloat again,-128.011
 With the Musgroves there was the happy chat of perfect ease with Captain Harville the kind hearted intercourse of brother and sister with Lady Russell attempts at conversation which a delicious consciousness cut short with Admiral and Mrs Croft everything of peculiar cordiality and fervent interest which the same consciousness sought to conceal and with Captain Wentworth some moments of communications continually occurring and always the hope of more and always the knowledge of his being there,-803.959
 Yes could that be wrong after all that had passed But I cannot talk,-147.705
 She knew that when he now took up the Baronetage it was to drive the heavy bills of his tradespeople and the unwelcome hints of Mr Shepherd his agent from his thoughts,-286.987
 Emma knew it to have been very much the case,-83.653
 I have no such scruples and I am sure I could put up with every unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort,-205.4
 Why to own the truth cried Miss Bates who had been trying in vain to be heard the last two minutes if I must speak on this subject there is no denying that Mr Frank Churchill might have I do not mean to say that he did not dream it I am sure I have sometimes the oddest dreams in the world but if I am questioned about it I must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring for Mrs Perry herself mentioned it to my mother and the Coles knew of it as well as ourselves but it was quite a secret known to nobody else and only thought of about three days,-1046.289
 Frank Churchill turned towards her to listen,-74.164
 John Dashwood was really far from being sorry to see his sisters again it rather gave them satisfaction and his inquiries after their mother were respectful and attentive,-303.602
 While he was so dull it was no wonder that Harriet should be dull likewise and they were both insufferable,-199.735
 She turned through the same gate but could not see them,-104.442
 This however was more than she could believe herself and to be composed at such a moment was not only beyond the reach of Marianne it was beyond her wish,-273.305
 If he were every thing else must give way but otherwise his friend Cole had been saying so much about his dining with him had made such a point of it that he had promised him conditionally to come,-356.938
 As soon as they were out of sight the ladies of Captain Wentworth s party began talking of them,-172.48
 dear Mrs Croft cried Mrs Musgrove unable to let her finish her speech there is nothing I so abominate for young people as a long engagement,-267.435
 It was foolish it was wrong to take so active a part in bringing any two people together,-196.657
 My dearest child said her mother laughing at this rate you must be in continual terror of MY decay and it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty,-390.162
 I feel a strong persuasion this morning that I shall soon be abroad,-127.572
 The resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening,-138.825
 Wentworth Captain Wentworth of the navy,-68.613
 He spoke of its being out of repair,-82.266
 Much as you suffer now think of what you would have suffered if the discovery of his character had been delayed to a later period if your engagement had been carried on for months and months as it might have been before he chose to put an end to it,-482.677
 Elinor flattered herself that some one of their connections in London would write to them to announce the event and give farther particulars but day after day passed off and brought no letter no tidings,-385.131
 Hum said Mrs Ferrars very pretty and without regarding them at all returned them to her daughter,-163.602
 His wish of staying longer evidently did not please but it was not opposed,-147.655
 I could wish the stairs were handsome,-76.335
 Modest Sir Walter,-34.141
 Their hours were therefore made over to Lady Middleton and the two Miss Steeles by whom their company in fact was as little valued as it was professedly sought,-307.657
 My dear said he to his lady it is very provoking that we should be so few,-158.545
 I only mean that if Mr Elliot should some time hence pay his addresses to you and if you should be disposed to accept him I think there would be every possibility of your being happy together,-345.627
 Pleased to find herself more comfortably situated in that particular than she had expected Elinor was very willing to compound for the want of much real enjoyment from any of their evening parties which whether at home or abroad formed only for cards could have little to amuse her,-493.305
 Engagement,-11.28
 It would be a great comfort to Mr Weston as he grew older and even Mr Weston might be growing older ten years hence to have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense the freaks and the fancies of a child never banished from home and Mrs Weston no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her and it would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach should not have their powers in exercise again,-781.623
 she repeated surprised at his being so long in the same county with Elinor without seeing her before,-178.533
 Captain Benwick had been seen flying by their house with a countenance which showed something to be wrong and they had set off immediately informed and directed as they passed towards the spot,-335.432
 Well my dear I wish you joy of it again and again and if ever there was a happy couple in the world I think I shall soon know where to look for them,-298.878
 Have you forgot the last evening of our being together at Barton,-128.672
 Emma found that she must wait and now it required little effort,-124.645
 said Mr Woodhouse always the last to make his way in conversation then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady,-270.651
 She had never seen Frank Churchill so silent and stupid,-104.049
 Lady Middleton was more agreeable than her mother only in being more silent,-134.549
 Upon the knoll behind the house,-61.796
 And you really are not engaged to him,-76.414
 Mr Dixon s preference of her music to her friend s I can answer for being very decided,-177.764
 He omitted no opportunity of being with them threw himself in their way called at all hours but I need not be particular on this subject,-252.179
 I am serious Miss Woodhouse whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy I am sick of England and would leave it to morrow if I could,-252.017
 No you shall send it to Hartfield if you please,-102.723
 She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness,-79.991
 He shook his head with a smile and looked as if he had very little doubt and very little mercy,-186.67
 In this calm kind of way with very little interest on either side they continued to talk both of them out of spirits and the thoughts of both engaged elsewhere,-314.566
 And thus ended their discourse,-65.651
 One thing DID disturb her and of that she made her daily complaint,-136.14
 You know his hand I dare say a charming one it is but that is not written so well as usual He was tired I dare say for he had just filled the sheet to me as full as possible,-375.538
 said Marianne my dear Edward this must not be,-89.002
 He will think all the happiness all the advantage on your side of the question all the merit on mine,-191.485
 Sir John wanted the whole family to walk to the Park directly and look at his guests,-172.238
 No sooner was his father s funeral over than Mrs John Dashwood without sending any notice of her intention to her mother in law arrived with her child and their attendants,-293.731
 Chapter 14,-26.637
 I remember Fanny used to say that she would marry sooner and better than you did not but what she is exceedingly fond of YOU but so it happened to strike her,-305.836
 We are not asked to dine with them however till the day after Mrs Musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey which is not very likely considering the care that will be taken of her and it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to morrow,-490.406
 It was a merry joyous party and no one seemed in higher spirits than Captain Wentworth,-163.146
 And when Mrs Bates was saying something to Emma whispered farther We do not say a word of any assistance that Perry might have not a word of a certain young physician from Windsor Oh,-344.081
 I do not think she has been in this house three times this summer,-125.447
 Jane,-18.891
 I thought our judgments were given us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours,-150.456
 I should very much like to see Lyme again said Anne,-105.583
 The sight of you Edward is the only comfort it has afforded and thank Heaven,-161.982
 You find me trying to be useful tell me if you think I shall succeed,-145.309
 Mr Elton is a very pretty young man to be sure and a very good young man and I have a great regard for him,-186.535
 Thy ready wit the word will soon supply,-93.034
 We really must wish you good night,-81.249
 Mr Weston must be between forty and fifty,-89.701
 He had made his fortune bought his house and obtained his wife and was beginning a new period of existence with every probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through,-336.561
 Not to my feelings,-45.601
 The change was indubitable,-50.574
 I could not give any connected detail yesterday but the suddenness and in one light the unseasonableness with which the affair burst out needs explanation for though the event of the 26th ult as you will conclude immediately opened to me the happiest prospects I should not have presumed on such early measures but from the very particular circumstances which left me not an hour to lose,-653.271
 There is something about Frederick more to our taste,-100.632
 He was more engaged with Louisa than with Henrietta,-98.842
 I suspect said Sir Walter coolly that Admiral Croft will be best known in Bath as the renter of Kellynch Hall,-205.02
 Altered beyond his knowledge,-49.994
 She rather suspected it to be so on the very first evening of their being together from his listening so attentively while she sang to them and when the visit was returned by the Middletons dining at the cottage the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again,-476.631
 Sir Walter Elliot of Kellynch Hall in Somersetshire was a man who for his own amusement never took up any book but the Baronetage there he found occupation for an idle hour and consolation in a distressed one there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents there any unwelcome sensations arising from domestic affairs changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over the almost endless creations of the last century and there if every other leaf were powerless he could read his own history with an interest which never failed,-1059.751
 I hope Mrs Bates and Miss Fairfax are,-73.691
 ONE person I was sure would represent me as capable of any thing What I felt was dreadful My resolution was soon made and at eight o clock this morning I was in my carriage,-361.017
 Well if you give me such kind encouragement Mr Elton I believe I shall try what I can do,-182.44
 These convictions must unquestionably have their own pain and severe was its kind but they precluded that pain which Lady Russell would suffer in entering the house again and returning through the well known apartments,-387.856
 He hoped she might make some amends for the many very plain faces he was continually passing in the streets,-209.93
 How much could it not tempt her to forgive,-101.93
 The struggle was great but it ended too soon,-101.476
 Only half an hour before her friend called for her at Mrs Goddard s her evil stars had led her to the very spot where at that moment a trunk directed to The Rev Philip Elton White Hart Bath was to be seen under the operation of being lifted into the butcher s cart which was to convey it to where the coaches past and every thing in this world excepting that trunk and the direction was consequently a blank,-778.657
 Breakfast had not been long over when they were joined by Captain and Mrs Harville and Captain Benwick with whom they had appointed to take their last walk about Lyme,-294.361
 replied Charles what s an evening party,-90.973
 Oh don t be so sly before us said Mrs Palmer for we know all about it I assure you and I admire your taste very much for I think he is extremely handsome,-324.865
 I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man,-89.806
 She says I fidget her to death and Miss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same,-178.198
 Mr Weston was to call in the evening and she must return it by him,-125.306
 You are trying not to smile,-63.016
 So dull so wretchedly dull But I have much to say to you on that head which cannot be said now,-211.674
 He had been so fortunate as to I forget the precise words one has no business to remember them,-185.252
 Do you know Miss Bates s niece,-71.463
 I have often thought them the worst of the two replied he coolly,-127.477
 Such an opportunity of being with Edward and his family was above all things the most material to her interest and such an invitation the most gratifying to her feelings,-293.893
 How could he contrive to come,-65.961
 But she was too ignorant and giddy for respect and he had never loved her,-129.256
 I am a great advocate for timidity and I am sure one does not often meet with it But in those who are at all inferior it is extremely prepossessing,-260.532
 All these jealousies and discontents however were so totally unsuspected by Mrs Jennings that she thought it a delightful thing for the girls to be together and generally congratulated her young friends every night on having escaped the company of a stupid old woman so long,-469.542
 There she sat and who would have guessed how many tears she had been lately shedding,-163.323
 But it was too late,-43.542
 An airing in the Hartfield carriage would have been the rack and arrowroot from the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison,-180.454
 But I kept my eye on it and as soon as I dared caught it up and never parted with it again from that moment,-239.929
 She would not look again,-44.746
 And my dear whenever he comes you had better let him look at little Bella s throat,-190.342
 Ay so do Sir John cried Mrs Jennings and then perhaps you may find out what his business is,-199.954
 I offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own than when you almost broke it eight years and a half ago,-260.642
 I have really for some time past for at least these three months cared nothing about him,-171.069
 I praised the fair lady too and altogether sent him away very happy,-146.297
 I shall not be far off if you want me,-89.796
 Anne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going,-133.078
 You are resolved to think him blameable because he took leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shewn,-237.638
 It was most unlikely therefore that he should ever want his father s assistance,-135.893
 Do you think so,-39.885
 It is infinitely too bad,-55.415
 You had somehow or other broken bounds yesterday and run away from your own management but to day you are got back again and as I cannot be always with you it is best to believe your temper under your own command rather than mine,-450.752
 Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she wanted observed Mrs Weston to him not in the least suspecting that she was addressing a lover The expression of the eye is most correct but Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes,-424.497
 I hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town,-128.326
 Harriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party,-110.586
 Yet she could not bear this silence,-71.93
 happy house could you know what I suffer in now viewing you from this spot from whence perhaps I may view you no more And you ye well known trees but you will continue the same No leaf will decay because we are removed nor any branch become motionless although we can observe you no longer No you will continue the same unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you occasion and insensible of any change in those who walk under your shade But who will remain to enjoy you,-984.92
 I cannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever,-87.576
 No till Cole alluded to my supposed attachment it had never entered my head,-156.803
 Truth obliged her to acknowledge some small share in the action but she was at the same time so unwilling to appear as the benefactress of Edward that she acknowledged it with hesitation which probably contributed to fix that suspicion in his mind which had recently entered it,-466.933
 In another moment a happier sight caught her Mr Knightley leading Harriet to the set Never had she been more surprized seldom more delighted than at that instant,-309.423
 Her change was equal This one half hour had given to each the same precious certainty of being beloved had cleared from each the same degree of ignorance jealousy or distrust On his side there had been a long standing jealousy old as the arrival or even the expectation of Frank Churchill He had been in love with Emma and jealous of Frank Churchill from about the same period one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other,-801.241
 At last however and after I had been six months in England I DID find her,-163.728
 But while she wondered at the difference of the two young men she did not find that the emptiness of conceit of the one put her out of all charity with the modesty and worth of the other,-343.685
 Frank Churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of Miss Fairfax s situation in life,-163.691
 You were very bad with the measles that is you would have been very bad but for Perry s great attention,-202.454
 Can not we be gone to morrow,-82.76
 One is so fenced and guarded from the weather that not a breath of air can find its way unpermitted,-217.018
 He must love somebody,-50.712
 When you have lived to my age you will begin to think letters are never worth going through the rain for,-225.3
 Have you finished it,-45.467
 Anne had not wanted this visit to Uppercross to learn that a removal from one set of people to another though at a distance of only three miles will often include a total change of conversation opinion and idea,-410.91
 There is no comparison between them,-57.382
 I want your interest with him,-60.211
 Let us be discreet quite on our good behaviour Hush You remember those lines I forget the poem at this moment,-237.032
 Certainly Captain Benwick,-39.017
 They then talked on for a few minutes longer without her catching a syllable when another lucky stop in Marianne s performance brought her these words in the Colonel s calm voice,-345.918
 In Colonel Brandon alone of all her new acquaintance did Elinor find a person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities excite the interest of friendship or give pleasure as a companion,-380.685
 She hardly wished to have more leisure for them,-89.407
 And the more sensibility you betray of their just horrors the more I shall like you,-174.255
 They were interrupted by the servant s coming in to announce the carriage being at the door and Mrs Jennings immediately preparing to go said,-234.251
 It is not likely that I should now see or hear any thing to change them,-148.623
 But that he should talk of encouragement should consider her as aware of his views accepting his attentions meaning in short to marry him should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind look down upon her friend so well understanding the gradations of rank below him and be so blind to what rose above as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her It was most provoking,-730.896
 Sir Walter indeed though he had no affection for Anne and no vanity flattered to make him really happy on the occasion was very far from thinking it a bad match for her,-320.239
 Her manners too and Mr Elton s were unpleasant towards Harriet,-114.537
 Her affection must have overpowered her judgment,-82.81
 said she in a low and disappointed voice as she turned away to the window,-142.12
 She was reminded more than once of having always said she would never marry and assured that it would be a great deal better for her to remain single and told of poor Isabella and poor Miss Taylor But it would not do,-382.519
 But Mr Woodhouse how was Mr Woodhouse to be induced to consent he who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a distant event,-250.708
 Why was it so much worse that Harriet should be in love with Mr Knightley than with Frank Churchill,-179.426
 Not till the first week of August when he came home from the Cape just made into the Grappler,-193.378
 I certainly get better and better Now for it,-96.725
 He had walked up one day after dinner as he very often did to spend his evening at Hartfield,-191.861
 She left it to himself to recollect that Mrs Smith was not the only widow in Bath between thirty and forty with little to live on and no surname of dignity,-308.046
 After that I suppose I WAS wrong in remaining so much in Sussex and the arguments with which I reconciled myself to the expediency of it were no better than these The danger is my own I am doing no injury to anybody but myself,-479.57
 Within a fortnight,-44.606
 no I would get you a better partner than myself,-109.201
 This is full proof undoubtedly proof of every thing you were saying,-125.778
 Smith had somehow or other been informed I imagine by some distant relation whose interest it was to deprive me of her favour of an affair a connection but I need not explain myself farther he added looking at her with an heightened colour and an enquiring eye your particular intimacy you have probably heard the whole story long ago,-647.484
 You need not be afraid Miss Elliot of your own sweet flower gardens being neglected,-159.646
 Anne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness and quite as much so for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying,-232.958
 A woman of seven and twenty said Marianne after pausing a moment can never hope to feel or inspire affection again and if her home be uncomfortable or her fortune small I can suppose that she might bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse for the sake of the provision and security of a wife,-586.408
 I assure you Miss Woodhouse it is very delightful to me to be reminded of a place I am so extremely partial to as Maple Grove,-234.655
 She supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his clemency but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself in his opinion,-281.822
 Miss Woodhouse,-22.41
 Emma in the meanwhile could not be satisfied without a dinner at Hartfield for the Eltons,-147.613
 He had not time to enter into much explanation,-88.99
 But I only mean to say that there are advertising offices and that by applying to them I should have no doubt of very soon meeting with something that would do,-283.953
 Her making a fourth when they sat down to dinner was noticed as an advantage,-155.704
 But in return your sister must allow me to feel no more than I profess,-143.649
 Quite the contrary replied Elinor looking expressively at Marianne,-109.835
 My dear Mrs,-31.45
 Mrs Dashwood feared to hazard any remark and ventured not to offer consolation,-153.306
 cried Marianne her eyes sparkling with animation and her cheeks glowing with the delight of such imaginary happiness,-195.672
 That has been a very great improvement,-68.203
 He was immediately interested,-44.987
 Jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold,-123.878
 Our respected father as you well know bequeathed all the Stanhill effects that remained at Norland and very valuable they were to your mother,-250.611
 He stays till to morrow and Miss Fairfax has been persuaded to spend the day with us They are coming in I hope,-221.62
 She had seen the same Frederick Wentworth,-65.375
 How will a conundrum reckon,-70.729
 I shall never forget his flying Henry s kite for him that very windy day last Easter and ever since his particular kindness last September twelvemonth in writing that note at twelve o clock at night on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham I have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence If any body can deserve him it must be Miss Taylor,-783.335
 I have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn every blessing that I enjoyed,-172.381
 You surprise me I should think it must nearly have escaped her memory by THIS time,-167.957
 Once I felt the fire rather too much but then I moved back my chair a little a very little and it did not disturb me,-264.496
 It was not the first time of her feeling the same kind of conviction for more than once before beginning with the observation of your sister looks unwell to day or your sister seems out of spirits he had appeared on the point either of disclosing or of inquiring something particular about her,-505.02
 The substance of this letter was forwarded to Emma in a note from Mrs Weston instantly,-149.918
 Oh dear,-26.35
 Not that you have any reason to regret my dear Elinor,-105.936
 For two or three months longer I shall remain where I am and as I am,-152.245
 Elinor saw with great uneasiness the low spirits of her friend,-114.128
 At her time of life any thing of an illness destroys the bloom for ever,-153.336
 You are very right in supposing how my money would be spent some of it at least my loose cash would certainly be employed in improving my collection of music and books,-333.645
 But Mr Elton in person had driven away all such cares,-122.694
 Then remembering Colonel Brandon reproved herself felt that to HIS sufferings and his constancy far more than to his rival s the reward of her sister was due and wished any thing rather than Mrs Willoughby s death,-382.769
 This is a pleasure said he in rather a low voice coming at least ten minutes earlier than I had calculated,-210.85
 What a thinking brain you have,-68.931
 Mrs Smith had been carried away from her first direction and Anne had forgotten in the interest of her own family concerns how much had been originally implied against him but her attention was now called to the explanation of those first hints and she listened to a recital which if it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of Mrs Smith proved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her very deficient both in justice and compassion,-774.632
 She is playing Robin Adair at this moment his favourite,-102.681
 But neither Charles Hayter s feelings nor anybody s feelings could interest her till she had a little better arranged her own,-227.05
 Elinor confirmed in every pleasant hope was all cheerfulness rejoicing that in her letters to her mother she had pursued her own judgment rather than her friend s in making very light of the indisposition which delayed them at Cleveland and almost fixing on the time when Marianne would be able to travel,-531.471
 I hope his letter does not breathe the spirit of an ill used man,-147.165
 Shall we walk Augusta,-59.399
 I should have been sorry Mr Knightley to be dependent on your recommendation had I quitted Mr Woodhouse s family and wanted another situation I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any body,-359.532
 Instead of talking of Edward they came gradually to talk only of Robert a subject on which he had always more to say than on any other and in which she soon betrayed an interest even equal to his own and in short it became speedily evident to both that he had entirely supplanted his brother,-555.651
 Mrs Dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth it was ready furnished and she might have immediate possession,-174.689
 I had no reason to believe her of less authority now,-105.914
 He stopped,-27.038
 One question after this only remained undecided between them one difficulty only was to be overcome,-180.76
 Yes yes but I am amused that he should have seen so far into my feelings,-148.006
 He has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all You must let me read it to him,-183.828
 I was at Norland about a month ago,-79.361
